## Introduction: Il Milione
Marco Polo wasn't the first European to visit China.
But he was the first to write a bestseller.
While in a Genoese prison (captured in war), he dictated his stories to a romance writer (Rustichello).
"Il Milione" (The Million Lies).
Europeans didn't believe him.
"Black stones that burn?" (Coal).
"Paper that is money?" (Fiat).

## 1. Kublai Khan
Marco served the Mongol Emperor (Grandson of Genghis Khan).
He traveled the Silk Road.
He saw a civilization far more advanced than Europe.
He described huge cities (Hangzhou) with bathhouses and sewers.
Europe was still throwing poop in the street.

## 2. Legacy
On his deathbed, friends begged him to admit he lied.
He said: "I have not told half of what I saw."
His book inspired Christopher Columbus.
Columbus carried a copy of Polo's book when he sailed to "India" (America).

> **One-Minute Summary**

> **Marco Polo** (1254–1324) was a Venetian merchant and explorer who traveled through Asia along the Silk Road between 1271 and 1295.

## Introduction: The Strait
Spain wanted a route to the Spice Islands (Indonesia).
Portuguese controlled the East (Africa route).
So Magellan went West.
He found a passage through South America (Strait of Magellan).
It was a nightmare of storms and freezing cold.

## 1. The Pacific
He broke through to the other ocean.
It was so calm he named it "Mar Pacifico" (Peaceful Sea).
He underestimated the size. It took 99 days to cross.
The crew ate rats and sawdust (Scurvy).

## 2. Mactan
He reached the Philippines.
He got involved in a local war (Hubris).
Chief Lapu-Lapu killed him in the surf at Mactan.
Juan Sebastián Elcano finished the voyage.
They proved the world was round—and vast.
The cloves they brought back paid for the entire sunken fleet.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ferdinand Magellan** led the Spanish expedition of 1519–1522 that achieved the first **Circumnavigation** of the Earth. Although Magellan died in battle in the Philippines, his expedition proved that the globe could be circled by sea and revealed the true, massive scale of the Pacific Ocean.

## Introduction: The Purchase
In 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana Territory to the US for $15 million.
It doubled the size of the country.
Jefferson wanted to find a "Northwest Passage" (River route) to the Pacific.
He sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.

## 1. Sacagawea
They rowed up the Missouri River.
They would have died without **Sacagawea**.
A Shoshone teenager with a baby on her back.
She acted as a translator and guide.
When they met a hostile tribe (Shoshone), the Chief turned out to be her brother.
It saved the expedition.

## 2. The Ocean
They crossed the Rockies (starvation).
They reached the Pacific in 1805. "Ocean in view! O! The joy!"
They didn't find a continuous river (it doesn't exist).
But they mapped the west, discovered 300 new species, and opened the door for Manifest Destiny.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Lewis and Clark Expedition** (1804–1806) was the first American expedition to cross the western portion of the United States. Commissioned by Thomas Jefferson after the Louisiana Purchase, their goal was to map the territory, find a route to the Pacific, and establish an American presence before Britain could claim the land.

## Introduction: The Hajj
In 1325, a 21-year-old scholar left Morocco for Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca).
He didn't come home for 24 years.
He just kept going.
"I decided to traverse the earth."

## 1. The Dar al-Islam
He proved the unity of the Islamic world.
He traveled from Spain to West Africa, to India, to China.
Everywhere he went, he found Muslim communities, scholars, and judges (Qadis).
Because he spoke Arabic (the Lingua Franca), he could work as a judge anywhere.
He survived bandits, shipwrecks, and the Black Death.

## 2. The Rihla
He dictated his journey ("The Rihla").
He provides the only eyewitness accounts of many medieval empires (like Mali and Mansa Musa).
While Polo wrote about trade, Battuta wrote about people, sex, and religion.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ibn Battuta** (1304–1369) was a Moroccan scholar and explorer who traveled more extensively than any other individual in pre-modern history, covering approximately 75,000 miles (120,000 km) across Africa, Europe, and Asia. His travelogue, the *Rihla*, is a masterpiece of medieval geography and anthropology.

## Introduction: The Endurance
1914. Shackleton aimed to cross Antarctica.
His ship, the *Endurance*, got trapped in pack ice.
It was crushed and sank.
They were camped on floating ice floes for months, drifting north.
Eating penguins and seals.

## 1. The Boat Journey
The ice melted. They took 3 lifeboats to Elephant Island.
It was a desolate rock. No one would ever look for them there.
Shackleton took 5 men and sailed a 22-foot boat (The James Caird) across the worst ocean in the world (The Southern Ocean).
800 miles. Hurricane winds.
If they missed South Georgia Island, they would be lost in the Atlantic.

## 2. The Crossing
They hit the island. But on the wrong side.
Shackleton and two others climbed over the glaciated mountains (never done before).
They stumbled into a whaling station. "My name is Shackleton."
He went back 4 times to rescue his men.
"Not a life lost, and we have been through Hell."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition** (1914–1917), led by **Sir Ernest Shackleton**, failed its mission but became legendary for its feat of survival. After their ship *Endurance* was crushed by ice, the crew survived for over a year on the ice and uninhabited islands. Shackleton's open-boat journey to South Georgia is considered one of the greatest feats of navigation in history.
