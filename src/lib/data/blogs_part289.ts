## Introduction: The Somerton Man
On December 1, 1948, the body of an unidentified man was found on Somerton Park beach in Adelaide.
He was well-dressed.
He had an unsmoked cigarette on his collar.
He looked like a dancer.
The autopsy found his spleen was enlarged (suggesting poison), but no poison was found.
But the weirdest part was his pocket.

## 1. The Scrap of Paper
Police found a tiny rolled-up scrap of paper hidden in a secret pocket of his trousers.
It read **"Tamám Shud"** (Persian for "The End" or "Finished").
The scrap was torn from a rare edition of *The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*.
Police found the specific book it was torn from in the back of a car nearby.
On the back of the book was a mysterious code (WRGOABABD) and a phone number.

## 2. Updated Science (2022)
For 70 years, people thought he was a Soviet Spy.
In 2022, Professor Derek Abbott used DNA from hairs found on the man's plaster mask.
He identified him as **Carl "Charles" Webb**, an electrical engineer from Melbourne.
Why was he in Adelaide? Why the code? Why the labels cut off?
Webb was depressed and separated from his wife (who had moved to South Australia).
The "spy code" was likely just betting scribbles for horses.
The mystery of *who* he was is solved. The mystery of *why* he died remains.

> The **Taman Shud Case** involves the 1948 discovery of an unidentified man on Somerton Beach, Australia. Famous for the "Tamám Shud" scrap of paper found in his pocket and an undecipherable code, the case fueled spy theories for decades. In 2022, DNA analysis identified him as **Carl Webb**, an electrical engineer, though the exact circumstances of his death (suicide or poisoning) remain inconclusive.

## Introduction: The Stranger
In March 1922, strange things happened at the **Hinterkaifeck** farm in Bavaria.
The father told neighbors he found footprints in the snow leading *from* the forest *to* the farm... but none leading back.
He heard footsteps in the attic.
A set of house keys went missing.
The maid quit because she thought the house was haunted.

## 1. The Massacre
On March 31, the entire Gruber family (6 people, including the 2-year-old grandson) were killed.
They were lured to the barn one by one and struck with a **Mattock** (a pickaxe).
The bodies were stacked and covered with hay.

## 2. The Aftermath
The bodies weren't found for 4 days.
During those 4 days, neighbors saw smoke coming from the chimney.
The cattle were fed.
The dog was tied up.
Food was eaten from the pantry.
**The killer stayed in the house.**
He lived amongst the corpses of the family he just slaughtered, tending to the farm, before vanishing into the night.
The case remains unsolved to this day.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Hinterkaifeck Murders** (1922) involve the brutal slaying of six people on a remote Bavarian farmstead. The case is infamous for the chilling details: the killer unbeknownst to the victims had likely been hiding in the attic for days prior (footprints leading to the house but not away), and continued to live on the farm for several days *after* the murders, feeding the livestock and eating food before disappearing.

## Introduction: The Passenger
On November 24, 1971, a man named "Dan Cooper" boarded a flight from Portland to Seattle.
He was wearing a black suit and sunglasses.
He handed a note to the flight attendant: "Miss, I have a bomb in my briefcase."
He wasn't aggressive. He was calm. He was polite. He tipped the staff.

## 1. The Ransom
He demanded **$200,000** (about $1.5M today) and **4 parachutes**.
The plane landed in Seattle, exchanged the passengers for the money, and took off again towards Mexico.
Somewhere over the dense forests of Washington, Cooper lowered the rear stairs (the **Aft Stairs**) of the 727.
He jumped into the freezing rain.

## 2. The Legacy
He was never found.
In 1980, a boy found $5,800 of the ransom money rotting on a riverbank.
Did Cooper survive?
Probaby not. He jumped at night, in a rainstorm, into a forest, wearing a suit and loafers.
But because no body was ever found, he remains a folk hero.
He changed aviation forever: All Boeing 727s were retrofitted with a "Cooper Vane" to prevent the rear stairs from opening in flight.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **D.B. Cooper** is the media epithet for an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 in 1971, extorted $200,000 in ransom, and parachuted from the plane's rear exit. Despite an extensive FBI manhunt and the discovery of a small portion of the cash in 1980, neither Cooper nor the rest of the money has ever been found. It remains the only unsolved air piracy case in commercial aviation history.

## Introduction: This is the Zodiac Speaking
Between 1968 and 1969, the **Zodiac Killer** murdered at least 5 people in the San Francisco Bay Area.
He targeted young couples in remote areas.
But he wanted fame more than blood.
He sent letters to the *San Francisco Chronicle* containing detailed descriptions of the murders and complex **Cryptograms** (ciphers).
He threatened to kill a dozen people if his letters weren't published on the front page.

## 1. The 340 Cipher
His first cipher (Z408) was solved in a week by a teacher. It said: "I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN."
His second cipher (**Z340**) was much harder.
It baffled the FBI, the NSA, and naval intelligence for decades.
It was finally solved in **2020** by a team of amateur codebreakers using a supercomputer.
It said: "I HOPE YOU ARE HAVING LOTS OF FUN IN TRYING TO CATCH ME... I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE GAS CHAMBER."

## 2. Who Was He?
The leading suspect was **Arthur Leigh Allen**.
He had a Zodiac watch. He owned the same boots as the killer. He told friends he wanted to hunt people.
But his DNA didn't match the stamps on the letters.
The most famous serial killer in American history is still a ghost.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Zodiac Killer** was an unidentified serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s. He is known for sending taunting letters and cryptograms to the press. While his first cipher was solved quickly, his most famous code, the **Z340**, remained unsolved for 51 years until 2020. Despite thousands of suspects (most notably Arthur Leigh Allen), the case remains open.

## Introduction: The Fumes
Gloria Ramirez (31) arrived at Riverside General Hospital suffering from late-stage cervical cancer.
The medical staff tried to save her.
When a nurse drew her blood, she noticed an ammonia-like smell.
The blood contained manila-colored crystals.
Suddenly, the nurse passed out.
Then the medical resident passed out.
Then the respiratory therapist passed out.
In total, **23 staff members** became ill. 5 were hospitalized. The ER was evacuated.

## 1. Mass Hysteria?
The hospital initially claimed it was mass hysteria (psychological).
But one resident spent two weeks in the ICU with hepatitis and bone necrosis. You can't imagine bone damage.
What happened?

## 2. The DMSO Theory
The Livermore National Laboratory proposed a chemical chain reaction.
Ramirez was likely using **DMSO** (a home remedy for pain) on her skin.
The oxygen administered by the paramedics turned the DMSO into **DMSO2** (Dimethyl Sulfone).
When the blood was drawn into the cold syringe, the DMSO2 crystallized.
Through a further reaction (possibly with the hospital's defibrillations), it converted into **DMSO4** (Dimethyl Sulfate).
Dimethyl Sulfate is a powerful, volatile nerve gas.
Her body had accidentally become a chemical weapon factory.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Toxic Lady** case (Gloria Ramirez, 1994) is a medical mystery where hospital staff fell ill after exposure to a patient's blood and body. The prevailing theory is that Ramirez used **DMSO** (dimethyl sulfoxide) as a pain remedy, which, due to oxygen administration and defibrillation, underwent a series of chemical reactions within her body to form **Dimethyl Sulfate**, a potent blistering agent and nerve gas.
