## Introduction: The Surgery
To cure epilepsy, doctors sometimes cut the bridge between the two Brain hemispheres (Corpus Callosum).
The seizures stop.
But the two halves can no longer talk to each other.
Experiment: Roger Sperry.

## 1. The Experiment
Show a word "FORK" to the Left Eye (Right Brain).
Ask the patient: "What did you see?"
Patient says: "Nothing." (Because the Speech center is in the Left Brain, which saw nothing).
Ask the patient to *draw* with their left hand (controlled by Right Brain).
He draws a Fork.
Ask him: "Why did you draw a fork?"
He says: "I don't know, I just felt like it."
The Left Brain (The Interpreter) makes up a lie to explain the action of the Right Brain.

## 2. Alien Hand Syndrome
Sometimes, the hands fight.
A patient tries to button his shirt with his right hand. The left hand unbuttons it.
He tries to hug his wife. The left hand punches her.
There are two wills fighting for control of the body.

## 3. Are there two of you?
This implies consciousness is divisible.
Right Brain: Emotional, spacial, mute.
Left Brain: Logical, verbal, liar.
We usually think we are "One Person".
Actually, we are two pilots in a Jaeger (Pacific Rim), but only one has a microphone.

### Fact Box
*   **Confabulation:** The Left Brain is a relentless liar. If it doesn't know the answer, it invents one instantly and believes it. This explains why we rationalize our bad decisions. Your inner narrator is not reliable.

## Introduction: The Map
The brain has a map of the body (Homunculus).
If you cut off the arm... the map is still there.
The neurons for "Hand" are waiting for input.
They start firing randomly. "Clenched fist! Cramp! Fire!"
The patient feels excruciating pain in a hand that is in the trash.

## 1. Ramachandran's Mirror Box
Medication (Morphine) doesn't work. It's not physical pain; it's software error.
V.S. Ramachandran invented a box with a mirror.
Put the Good Hand in the box. The mirror reflects it.
To the brain, it looks like *two* healthy hands.
Move the good hand. The brain "sees" the phantom hand moving.
"Oh! The hand is unclenched. It is fine."
The brain updates the map. The pain vanishes.
Visual hacking of the nervous system.

## 2. Plasticity
This proved **Neuroplasticity**.
The brain is not rigorous. It can be rewired.
Blind people use their Visual Cortex for Braille.
The brain is generic hardware; the software adapts to the inputs available.

## 3. Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID)
The opposite.
A person has a healthy leg.
But their brain map says "No leg".
They feel the leg is an alien object attached to them. They want to amputate it.
They will freeze it or crush it to force doctors to remove it.
They are only happy once they are an amputee.
The map must match the territory.

### Fact Box
*   **Rubber Hand Illusion:** Put a rubber hand on the table. Hide your real hand. Stroke both with a brush. Your brain will "adopt" the rubber hand. If someone hits the rubber hand with a hammer, you will scream and pull away. Your sense of "Self" is fluid.

## Introduction: Crossed Wires
In babies, all senses are connected.
As we age, we prune the connections. Sight separates from Sound.
In Synesthetes, the pruning was incomplete.
The "Color" center is wired to the "Number" center.
4% of people have it.
Many artists (Kanye West, Pharrell, Nabokov).

## 1. Types
*   **Grapheme-Color:** Letters/Numbers have colors. A is Red. B is Blue.
*   **Chromesthesia:** Sounds have colors. A Trumpet is Orange.
*   **Lexical-Gustatory:** Words have tastes. "Basketball" tastes like waffles.
It is consistent. If 5 is Red today, it is Red in 10 years.

## 2. Advantages
Memory.
"I remember his phone number because it was a rainbow."
Daniel Tammet (Autistic Savant) recited Pi to 22,000 digits.
He didn't memorize numbers. He walked through a landscape of shapes and colors.
"Pi is a beautiful landscape."

## 3. The Kiki / Bouba Effect
Show people a Spiky shape and a Round shape.
Ask: Which is Kiki? Which is Bouba?
99% say Spiky = Kiki. Round = Bouba.
Why?
"Kiki" feels sharp in the mouth. "Bouba" feels round.
We are *all* slightly synesthetic.
Language itself is synesthetic (mating sounds to shapes).

### Fact Box
*   **Projecting:** Some synesthetes "Project" the colors into the real world. They literally see red numbers floating on the page. Others just "Know" it in their mind's eye (Associators).

## Introduction: Oliver Sacks
Dr. P (Music teacher).
He looked at his wife and tried to grab her head to put it on. He thought she was a hat.
He could see eyes, nose, mouth.
But he couldn't assemble them into a "Face".
Damage to the **Fusiform Gyrus** (The Face Area).

## 1. What is it like?
Imagine looking at a chair.
Now look at another chair.
Can you tell them apart? Maybe. But it's hard.
To a Face Blind person, all faces are like chairs.
"Two eyes, one nose. Generic."
They rely on cues: "The guy with the red scarf." "The woman with the limp."
If you change your hair... they don't know you.

## 2. Super Recognizers
The opposite exists.
Police use them.
They can look at grainy CCTV footage of an ear and recognize a suspect they saw 5 years ago.
Face recognition implies it is a specific "Module" in the brain, separate from general vision.

## 3. Thatcher Effect
Take a photo of Margaret Thatcher.
Turn the eyes and mouth upside down.
Turn the whole photo upside down.
It looks normal.
Turn it right side up... it looks horrific.
Why?
Upside down, the "Face Module" turns off. We inspect parts.
Right side up, the Module turns on and screams "WRONG CONFIGURATION".

### Fact Box
*   **Pareidolia:** The Face Module is so over-active it sees faces in toast, clouds, and Mars rocks. Evolutionarily, it is better to see a tiger that isn't there, than to miss a tiger that is there.

## Introduction: The Disconnect
Recognition has two paths:
1.  **Visual:** "That looks like Mom." (Temporal Lobe).
2.  **Emotional:** "I feel warmth." (Amygdala).
In Capgras, the wire to the Amygdala is cut.
Effect: "That looks exactly like Mom. But I feel nothing. Therefore, it is a perfect disguise."

## 1. Logic of Madness
It is hyper-logical.
"If it was really Mom, I would feel love. I don't. So it must be a fake."
Patients construct elaborate theories: CIA androids, aliens, shapeshifters.
They often attack the "Imposter".

## 2. Phone vs Face
Stranger fact:
If the patient talks to "Mom" on the phone... they believe it is her.
Why?
The *Auditory* path to the Amygdala is intact.
"Her voice allows me to feel. Her face does not."
It proves the visual disconnect.

## 3. Cotard's Delusion (Walking Corpse)
Related condition.
The emotional wire is cut to *everything*. Even yourself.
"I look in the mirror. I feel nothing. Therefore, I do not exist. I am dead."
Patients believe they are rotting corpses. They stop eating. They ask to be buried.
The brain needs Emotion to anchor Reality. Without feeling, logic leads to hell.

### Fact Box
*   **Fregoli Delusion:** The opposite. You believe different people are actually the *same* person in disguise. "The mailman is Bob. The doctor is Bob. Everyone is Bob following me."
