## Introduction: I Did That
Watch a baby. Their favorite toy is often a light switch. Click. Light. Click. Dark.
They are learning the most important lesson of life: "I am an agent. I cause things."
Robert White called this **Effectance Motivation**.

## 1. Competence
We aren't just hungry for food; we are hungry for **Competence**.
We need to feel capable of handling the environment.
This is why people do crossword puzzles or play video games.
There is no survival benefit to Tetris. But the feeling of "I cleared the line" is pure Effectance.

## 2. Helplessness
The opposite is **Learned Helplessness**.
If you push the button and nothing happens... you get depressed.
Depression is often a feeling of "Ineffectance"—that your actions don't matter.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Effectance Motivation** is the intrinsic desire to interact effectively with the environment. It explains why humans enjoy solving problems, mastering skills, and playing games even without external rewards. It is the drive for **Competence**: the psychological proof that our actions have consequences.

## Introduction: The Experiment
Researchers took kids who loved drawing.
Group A: Paid for every drawing.
Group B: Left alone.
Two weeks later, looking for fun, Group B was still drawing. Group A had stopped.
"No money? Then I won't draw."

## 1. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic
We have **Intrinsic Motivation** (doing it for love) and **Extrinsic Motivation** (doing it for money).
When you add money, the brain switches modes.
"Must be work if they are paying me."
The activity loses its joy. It becomes a transaction.

## 2. The Danger
This tells us to be careful about monetizing hobbies.
Once your hobby becomes your "Side Hustle," the Overjustification Effect kicks in.
You might lose the very thing that relaxed you.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Overjustification Effect** occurs when an expected external incentive (like money or prizes) decreases a person's intrinsic motivation to perform a task. The reward shifts the attribution of why they are doing it from "I like this" to "I am doing this for the reward," leading to a drop in interest once the reward is removed.

## Introduction: The Afterimage
Normally, memories are stored in the Hippocampus.
But repetitive motor tasks (like Tetris or driving) train the procedural memory.
The brain devotes neurons to "Pattern Recognition" for the game.
It doesn't turn off immediately.

## 1. Rewiring
The **Tetris Effect** describes when people devote so much time to an activity that it begins to pattern their thoughts, mental images, and dreams.
Lawyers start seeing life as "Liabilities".
Programmers see "If/Then" statements in relationships.
Your brain optimizes for what you do most.

## 2. Hypnagogic Hallucinations
It usually happens right as you fall asleep.
The sensory inputs cut off, and the brain's "Pattern Predictor" runs free.
It continues the last simulation it was running.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Tetris Effect** is a phenomenon where people who devote significant time to an activity begin to pattern their thoughts, mental images, and dreams around it. It demonstrates the brain's **Neuroplasticity**—its ability to rapidly rewire itself to optimize for specific tasks, even continuing the computation in the absence of the stimulus.

## Introduction: More is Less
We think we want freedom. We want 100 flavors of ice cream.
But the famous "Jam Study" (Sheena Iyengar) proved us wrong.
Table A: 24 Jams.
Table B: 6 Jams.
Table A got more *looks*.
But Table B got 10x more *sales*.

## 1. Analysis Paralysis
Choosing takes energy (Decision Fatigue).
With 2 options, you compare A vs B. 1 comparison.
With 24 options, the comparisons are exponential.
The brain gets overwhelmed and aborts. "I'll choose later."
(You never choose later).

## 2. Regret
With 6 options, if you pick Strawberry, you might regret missing Raspberry.
With 24 options, you regret missing 23 other flavors.
The "Opportunity Cost" feels higher.
Happiness = Reality - Expectations.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Choice Paralysis** (or the Paradox of Choice) is the observation that while having some choice is good, having too many choices leads to anxiety, indecision, and dissatisfaction. The cognitive load of evaluating options discourages action, and the fear of making the "wrong" choice reduces the enjoyment of the selection.

## Introduction: The Mug Study
Kahneman gave students a coffee mug worth \$5.
He then asked: "How much would you sell it for?"
Average answer: \$7.
He asked other students (who didn't have a mug): "How much would you pay for it?"
Average answer: \$3.
Ownership doubled the value.

## 1. Loss Aversion
We hate losing things more than we like getting things.
Selling the mug feels like a **Loss**.
Buying the mug is just a **Gain**.
The pain of loss is 2x the pleasure of gain.

## 2. Implications
This is why test drives sell cars. Once you drive it home, it feels like *yours*.
It's why you keep old clothes you never wear. "It might be useful."
To your brain, it's a treasure. To everyone else, it's trash.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Endowment Effect** is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. It is a manifestation of **Loss Aversion** and the **Status Quo Bias**. It explains market inefficiencies where sellers ask for prices higher than buyers are willing to pay, simply due to the emotional attachment of ownership.
