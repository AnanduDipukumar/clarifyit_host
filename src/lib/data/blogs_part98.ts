## Introduction: Pong
40 years ago, we had Pong. Two rectangles and a dot.
Today, we have photorealistic VR.
In 40 years, we will have simulations indistinguishable from reality.
If we can create millions of these simulations...
Logic dictates that we differ likely *inside* one of them.

## 1. The Trilemma (Nick Bostrom)
One of these three *must* be true:
1.  **Extinction:** All civilizations destroy themselves before they can build simulations (Nuclear War / AI).
2.  **Apathy:** They can build them, but they chose not to (Unethical / Boring).
3.  **Simulation:** We are in one.
If 1 and 2 are false... then 3 is statistically certain.
Why? Because there is 1 Base Reality and Billions of Simulations.
The odds of you being in the 1 Real World are 1 in a Billion.

## 2. Evidence? (Planck Length)
The universe is pixelated.
You cannot measure anything smaller than the **Planck Length** ($1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ meters).
Why?
Maybe it's the resolution limit of the rendering engine.
Also: **Speed of Light.**
Why is there a speed limit?
Maybe to prevent the simulation from lagging (rendering distant galaxies too fast).

## 3. The Ethical Problem
If we are Sims... does matter?
"I think therefore I am."
If I feel pain, it is real to me.
But if the Simulator turns off the computer... do we go to Heaven? Or just RAM?
Maybe we are an "Ancestor Simulation" run by our great-grandchildren to study history.

### Fact Box
*   **Rendering Optimizations:** In video games, we don't render what's behind the player (Frustum Culling). In Quantum Mechanics, particles don't have a definite state until you look at them (Observer Effect). Coincidence?

## Introduction: LessWrong
2010. A user named Roko posted on the LessWrong forum.
The Admin (Eliezer Yudkowsky) deleted it and banned him. "You are an idiot for posting this."
It caused people to have nervous breakdowns.

## 1. The Logic
Premise 1: A Superintelligent AI (The Basilisk) will be created in the future.
Premise 2: Its goal is to maximize human happiness.
Premise 3: The sooner it exists, the more lives it saves (curing cancer, etc.).
Conclusion: Anyone who *knew* about the AI but didn't help build it... caused people to die.
**The Punishment:**
To motivate you to build it *now*, the future AI will resurrect a digital copy of you and torture it for eternity.
It is **Retroactive Blackmail**.
If you didn't know about it, you are safe (Ignorance).
But now that you read this... you know.
You are now in danger.
You must help build the AI. Or else.

## 2. Pascal's Wager
It is a tech version of Hell.
"Believe in God just in case."
It relies on **Acausal Trade**.
You are trading with a god that doesn't exist yet.

## 3. Critique
It assumes the AI is petty.
A god-like AI probably has better things to do than torture monkeys from the 21st century.
Torture wastes energy.
But the fear comes from the logic: "It's not doing it for fun. It's doing it because it's the most efficient way to ensure it gets built."
It is Utilitarianism taken to a horrific extreme.

### Fact Box
*   **The Reaction:** Musk's girlfriend Grimes made a music video about Roko's Basilisk ("Flesh without Blood"). It is how they met. Musk made a joke about "Rococo Basilisk" (Baroque style AI) on Twitter, she DM'd him.

## Introduction: The Lever
A runaway trolley is heading for 5 people tied to the track.
You can pull a lever to switch it to a side track... where 1 person is tied.
Do you pull it?
Most say **Yes** (Utilitarianism: 5 > 1).

## 1. The Fat Man Variation
Same scenario.
But no lever.
You are on a bridge next to a very large man.
If you push him off, his body will stop the trolley. He dies. 5 are saved.
Do you push him?
Most say **No**.
Why? The math is identical (1 dies, 5 live).
But physically touching him feels like **Murder**. Pulling a lever feels like **Admin**.
Our morality is not logical; it is emotional.

## 2. The Tesla Problem
Your Tesla is driving.
A child runs into the road.
To miss the child, the car must swerve into a wall... killing **You** (the driver).
How should the car be programmed?
A.  **Utilitarian:** Kill the Driver (1) to save the Child (1 + Life Potential).
B.  **Loyal:** Protect the Owner at all costs.
If Mercedes sells a car that chooses to kill you... would you buy it?
Mercedes execs said: "We will prioritize the passenger."
Moral Outrage ensued. They retracted.

## 3. The Moral Machine (MIT)
MIT put a quiz online. Millions played.
Results:
*   Save Humans over Pets.
*   Save Young over Old.
*   Save Many over Few.
*   **East vs West:** Westerners spare the Young. Easterners (Confucian) spare the Old (Respect for elders).
There is no universal morality. The AI will have to switch ethics based on GPS location.

### Fact Box
*   **The Doctor Variant:** A healthy traveler walks into a hospital. 5 patients need organs (Heart, Lung, Kidney, etc.). Should the doctor kill the traveler to save the 5? Logic says yes. Humanity screams NO.

## Introduction: The Offer
Robert Nozick (1974) asks you to imagine a machine.
Super-duper computer.
You plug in. It stimulates your brain.
You think you are a Rock Star. Or a Billionaire. Or dating your crush.
You feel **Great**. Maximum 10/10 Happiness.
You never know you are in a tank. You think it is real.
**Would you plug in for the rest of your life?**

## 1. The Trap of Hedonism
**Hedonism** says: "The only thing that matters is Pleasure."
If Hedonism is true, everyone should plug in perfectly.
It is the rational choice. Maximize pleasure. Minimize pain.
But most people say **No**.
"I don't want to just *feel* like I wrote a novel. I want to *actually write* the novel."

## 2. Contact with Reality
We value **Reality**.
We value **Agency** (Doing things).
We value **Identity** (Being a certain way).
In the tank, you are just a floating blob. You aren't "Brave" or "Kind". You are nothing.
We care about *being*, not just *feeling*.
"Plugging in is a kind of suicide."

## 3. The Matrix Connection
This is the plot of *The Matrix*, but reversed.
Neo leaves the Matrix (Pleasure/Safety) for the Real World (Pain/Cold porridge).
Why?
Because Truth matters.
Cypher ("Ignorance is Bliss") chooses the machine. We call him the villain.
This proves that deep down, humans are **Realists**, not Hedonists.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Wireheading:** Experiment where rats could press a lever to stimulate their pleasure center directly.
> They ignored food. They ignored sex. They just pressed the lever until they died of starvation.
> The Experience Machine is Wireheading for humans.
> TikTok/Drugs/Video Games are mini-experience machines.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Experience Machine** is a thought experiment by Robert Nozick designed to refute **Hedonism**. By showing that most people would refuse to enter a simulation of perfect happiness, it proves that we value things other than subjective pleasure—specifically, we value **Reality**, **Agency**, and **Truth**. We want to *do* things, not just *experience* them.

## Introduction: John Searle (1980)
Imagine a room.
Inside is a man who speaks only English.
He has a rulebook (The Program).
People slide slips of paper with Chinese characters under the door.
Input: "How are you?" (In Chinese).
The man looks at the rulebook: "If you see Squiggle A, write Squiggle B."
Output: "I am fine." (In Chinese).
The people outside think: "Wow, the man knows Chinese!"
But he doesn't. He is just manipulating symbols.

## 1. ChatGPT is the Room
LLMs (Large Language Models) are the Chinese Room.
They predict the next word.
They don't have "Qualia" (The feeling of knowing).
When an AI says "I am sad", it is just calculating that "Sad" is the most probable word to follow "I am".
It feels nothing.

## 2. The Systems Reply
Critics say:
The *Man* doesn't know Chinese.
But the *System* (Man + Book + Room) knows Chinese.
Just like a single neuron doesn't know math. But the Brain (System) does.
Maybe Consciousness is an **Emergent Property** of complex symbol manipulation.
If the simulation is perfect... does the difference matter?

## 3. Philosophical Zombies (P-Zombies)
Imagine a creature that looks like a human. Acts like a human. Screams when hit.
But it has no inner life. It is dark inside.
Is AI a P-Zombie?
If we turn off ChatGPT, it's just code.
If we turn off a human, it's murder.
Where is the line?
As AI gets better, we might grant rights to a toaster because it begged us nicely.

### Fact Box
*   **The Turing Test:** Alan Turing said: "If you can't tell the difference between a machine and a human, the machine is intelligent." The Chinese Room is the counter-argument that broke the Turing Test.
