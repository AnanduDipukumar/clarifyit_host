## Introduction: The Mont-Blanc
December 6, 1917. Nova Scotia.
The *SS Mont-Blanc* collided with the *SS Imo* in the Narrows.
The *Mont-Blanc* was a floating bomb. It carried 2.9 kilotons of explosives (TNT, Picric Acid, Benzol).
A fire started.

## 1. The Blast
Crowds gathered to watch the fire.
At 9:04 AM, the ship vaporized.
The blast wave flattened 2 square kilometers of the city.
It created a tsunami. It shattered windows 50 miles away.
2,000 people died instantly. 9,000 were blinded by flying glass.

## 2. Oppenheimer
The physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer studied the Halifax explosion to predict the radius of the Atomic Bomb.
It remains the standard for accidental detonation.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Halifax Explosion** occurred when a cargo ship fully loaded with wartime explosives collided with a Norwegian vessel. The resulting blast released energy equivalent to 2.9 kilotons of TNT, obliterating the Richmond district of Halifax. It remains the largest non-nuclear man-made explosion in human history.

## Introduction: The Tank
Purity Distilling Company built a massive tank in the North End.
It held 2.3 million gallons of Molasses (used for Rum and Ethanol).
It was built cheaply. It leaked so bad they painted it brown to hide the leaks.

## 1. The Burst
January 15, 1919. A warm day.
The molasses expanded. The rivets popped like machine-gun fire.
The wave wasn't slow. Since molasses is non-Newtonian, the sheer mass moved like a mudslide.
It crushed buildings. It derailed a train.

## 2. The Rescuers
Rescuers got stuck in the goo.
As the night cooled, the molasses hardened, trapping victims in amber.
Boston smelled like maple syrup for decades.
It led to the first requirement for engineers to actually sign and approve blueprints.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Great Molasses Flood** was a disaster in Boston where a storage tank burst, releasing a wave of molasses that moved at 35 mph. The high viscosity of the fluid made it incredibly destructive and difficult to escape. The subsequent lawsuit was a landmark case in establishing modern engineering certification and liability laws.

## Introduction: Tambora
In 1815, Mount Tambora exploded. The largest eruption in 1,300 years.
It spewed megatons of ash and sulfur into the stratosphere.
The sulfur reflected the sun (Volcanic Winter).
The Earth cooled by 1°C.

## 1. The Famine (1816)
Crops failed worldwide.
In New England, frost killed the corn in August.
Horses were eaten because there were no oats.
This lack of horses led Karl Drais to invent the **Bicycle** (The Hobby Horse).

## 2. The Monsters
In Switzerland, it rained incessantly.
A group of friends was stuck indoors on a vacation. Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, and Mary Shelley.
To pass the time, they told ghost stories.
Mary Shelley wrote **Frankenstein**.
John Polidori wrote **The Vampyre** (the precursor to Dracula).
Our modern horror icons were born from a volcano.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Year Without a Summer** (1816) was a severe global cooling event caused by the eruption of **Mount Tambora**. The resulting crop failures caused major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere. The gloomy weather inspired Mary Shelley to write *Frankenstein*, and the lack of horse fodder purportedly inspired the invention of the bicycle.

## Introduction: The Vent
Centralia, PA was a coal town.
They tried to burn trash in an abandoned mine pit.
They didn't put it out properly.
The fire spread into the coal tunnels underground.

## 1. The Slow Burn
Coal seams can burn for centuries.
The ground became hot to the touch. Carbon Monoxide seeped into basements.
In 1981, a 12-year-old boy fell into a sinkhole that opened up in his backyard. The steam was 350°F. He was pulled to safety, but it was the final straw.

## 2. Evacuation
The government condemned the town.
They spent $42 million destroying 500 houses.
Today, only 5 people refuse to leave.
Smoke still rises from cracks in the Graffiti Highway.
The fire serves as the visual inspiration for the horror game/movie **Silent Hill**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Centralia Mine Fire** is a coal seam fire that has been burning underneath the borough of Centralia, Pennsylvania, since 1962. Efforts to extinguish it failed, and the underground fire continues to spread, creating dangerous sinkholes and toxic gas. Experts believe it could burn for another 250 years.

## Introduction: The Cloud
August 21, 1986. Cameroon.
Lake Nyos occupies a volcanic crater.
Magma deep underground releases CO2 into the water.
Normally, lakes mix (turnover). But Nyos is deep and still.
The CO2 built up at the bottom like a shook soda can.

## 1. The Pop
Something (a landslide?) triggered the water.
Decades of gas released at once (**Limnic Eruption**).
A cloud of heavier-than-air CO2 poured down the mountain at 60 mph.
It flowed into villages.
It displaced all the oxygen. No smell. No warning.
Livestock dropped dead. People died in their sleep.
When survivors woke up, they found 1,746 dead bodies with no wounds.

## 2. The Solution
Scientists installed pipes ("Degassing Columns") to siphon the bubbly water from the bottom, creating a fountain that safely vents the gas.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Limnic Eruption** is a rare natural disaster where dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from deep lake water. The **Lake Nyos Disaster** released 1.6 million tons of CO2, creating a suffocating blanket that killed every living thing within 15 miles. It is one of only two known deadly limnic eruptions in history.
