## Introduction: The Poverty of the Stimulus
Behaviorists (Skinner) said: "Language is a habit. We copy our parents."
Chomsky said: "Impossible."
A child hears imperfect sentences ("Mommy... milk... give").
Yet, by age 4, the child produces perfectly grammatical sentences they have *never heard before*.
"I hate the milk that the mommy gave."
There isn't enough data (Poverty of the Stimulus) to learn the rules from scratch.
Therefore, the rules must be innate.

## 1. The Language Acquisition Device (LAD)
Chomsky argued we have a "Language Organ" in the brain.
It contains **Universal Grammar**.
All languages share deep structures (Subject-Verb-Object).
English switches "Switch A". Japanese switches "Switch B".
But the "Motherboard" is the same.
This is why all human languages are translatable, but you can't translate "Dog Barking" into English.

## 2. Recursion
The key feature of human language is **Recursion**.
"The dog that chased the cat that ate the rat that..."
You can embed sentences inside sentences infinitely.
Monkeys can't do this.
Pirahã (an Amazonian language) supposedly *doesn't* have recursion, which challenges Chomsky... but the debate rages on.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> **Universal Grammar** is a theory in linguistics proposing that the ability to learn grammar is hard-wired into the brain. Suggested by **Noam Chomsky**, it explains why children learn languages so quickly despite limited input. It suggests that all human languages share a common underlying structural foundation.

## Introduction: The Lost Code
By 400 AD, nobody could read Egyptian Hieroglyphs.
The knowledge died with the pagan priests.
The pyramids were silent.
In 1799, French soldiers in Egypt found a slab.
It had a boring tax decree written in:
1.  **Hieroglyphs** (Top).
2.  **Demotic** (Middle - Egyptian script).
3.  **Greek** (Bottom).

## 1. Champollion cracks it
We could read Greek.
So we knew what the text said.
Jean-François Champollion realized the Hieroglyphs weren't just pictures (Ideograms).
They were *sounds* (Phonetics).
A picture of a Lion wasn't "Lion". It was the letter "L".
He used the name "Ptolemy" (circled in a cartouche) to map the sounds.
Suddenly, the stones could speak.

## 2. Unlocking History
Because of this one rock, we recovered 3,000 years of history.
We read the Book of the Dead. We read about the Battle of Kadesh.
Without it, Egypt would just be a pile of mysterious rocks.
The term "Rosetta Stone" now means the essential clue to a new field (e.g., DNA is the Rosetta Stone of life).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Rosetta Stone** is a granodiorite stele inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC. Because it included Ancient Greek (which was understood), it provided the key to deciphering **Egyptian Hieroglyphs**, opening up the entirety of Ancient Egyptian history to modern scholars.

## Introduction: Necessity
Two groups meet (Trade/Slavery). They don't share a language.
They create a **Pidgin**.
"You give me food. I give you money."
Pidgin has:
*   Limited vocabulary.
*   No grammar (No tense, no plurals).
*   It is nobody's mother tongue.

## 1. The Magic of Children
Then the children are born.
They hear the Pidgin.
Their brains (Universal Grammar) reject the chaos.
They *inject* grammar into it.
They add tense markers. They add complexity.
The Pidgin becomes a **Creole** (e.g., Haitian Creole, Tok Pisin).
Creole is a full, complex language.

## 2. Sign Language
In Nicaragua (1980s), deaf children were brought together for the first time.
They had no language.
They created a "Pidgin" of home signs.
The younger kids then turned it into **Nicaraguan Sign Language**—a fully grammatical language created *by children* in one generation.
It is the only time scientists have watched a language being born.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Pidgin** is a simplified communication system that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. A **Creole** is a stable natural language that develops from the simplifying and mixing of different languages into a new one. A Pidgin becomes a Creole when children acquire it as their **Native Language**.

## Introduction: The Discovery
Sir William Jones (in India) noticed that Sanskrit words looked like Latin.
**Mother:**
*   Sanskrit: Matr
*   Latin: Mater
*   English: Mother
**Three:**
*   Sanskrit: Trayas
*   Greek: Treis
*   English: Three
Coincidence? No.
They share a common ancestor: **Proto-Indo-European (PIE)**.

## 1. The Ghost Language
PIE was never written down.
We reconstruct it by running the changes backwards.
We know they had a word for "Wheel" (*kweklos*), "Horse", and "Snow".
This tells us they lived in a cold place with horses and wagons (The Pontic Steppe, 4500 BC).
They conquered Europe and India, spreading their language.

## 2. 50% of the World
Today, 3 billion people speak an Indo-European language.
It connects us.
"Yoga" (Sanskrit) and "Yoke" (English) come from the PIE root *yeug* (to join).
"Video" (Latin) and "Veda" (Sanskrit) come from *weid* (to see/know).
We are all speaking dialects of a ghost language.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Proto-Indo-European (PIE)** is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European language family (English, Spanish, Hindi, Russia, Farsi). Spoken around 4500 BC on the Eurasian Steppe, it was reconstructed by linguists using the **Comparative Method**. It proves the deep historical connection between cultures from Ireland to India.

## Introduction: "Actually..."
You say: "The team was decimated."
Nerd: "Actually, decimate means to kill 1 in 10 (Decem). So you can't be decimated if everyone died."
This nerd is committing the **Etymological Fallacy**.
The belief that a word's "True" meaning is found in its origin.

## 1. Drift
Language is democratic. Meaning is Usage.
If 99% of people use "Decimate" to mean "Destroy totally", then that is what it means.
*   **Awful:** Used to mean "Full of Awe" (Good). Now means Bad.
*   **Nice:** Used to mean "Foolish" (Latin *Nescius*).
*   **Meat:** Used to mean "Food" (any kind).
If we insisted on original meanings, "Salary" would mean "Salt money".

## 2. Prescriptivist vs Descriptivist
*   **Prescriptivist:** Wants to enforce rules. "Don't split infinitives!" (Because you can't in Latin).
*   **Descriptivist:** Observes how people speak. "People are splitting infinitives. Interesting."
Linguists are Descriptivists.
Language is a river, not a rock. Fighting the current is useless.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Etymological Fallacy** is the genetic fallacy that holds that the present-day meaning of a word or phrase should necessarily be similar to its historical meaning. It ignores **Semantic Shift**—the natural evolution where words change definition over time (e.g., "Awesome" meaning terrible -> great).
