## Introduction: The Immortal Line
In 1951, doctors took a sample of Henrietta Lacks's cervical cancer.
Usually, cells die in a petri dish after a few days.
Henrietta's didn't. They doubled every 24 hours.
They were **Immortal**.
They named them **HeLa** cells.

## 1. The Contribution
HeLa cells were sent to labs all over the world.
They were used to invent the **Polio Vaccine**.
They went to space.
They were used to study HIV, Cancer, and Radiation.
If you have ever taken medicine, you owe a debt to Henrietta Lacks.

## 2. The Theft
The dark side?
Nobody asked her permission. No one told her family.
For decades, companies made billions off HeLa cells while her children lived in poverty without health insurance.
It is the most famous case of medical ethics violation in history.
Science advanced, but Consent was left behind.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **HeLa cells** are the oldest and most commonly used human cell line in scientific research. Derived from cervical cancer cells taken from **Henrietta Lacks** in 1951 without her knowledge, they are "immortal" (they never stop dividing). They have been instrumental in developing vaccines and cancer treatments, sparking a global debate on patient rights and tissue ownership.

        description: "A parasite that makes mice love cats. And 30% of humans have it in their brains. Does it change our personality?",

## Introduction: The Cycle
*Toxoplasma gondii* can only reproduce in the stomach of a Cat.
If it ends up in a Mouse, it's stuck.
So it hacks the mouse's brain.
It kills the fear of cat urine. It actually makes the mouse *attracted* to the smell.
The mouse walks up to the cat -> Gets eaten -> Parasite wins.

## 1. The Human Hosts
Humans have cats. We get infected (Litter boxes).
Around 2 Billion people carry Toxo cysts in their brain.
Usually, it does nothing.
But some studies suggest infected humans are more risk-taking.
More likely to get into car accidents. More likely to have Schizophrenia.
Is the "Crazy Cat Lady" stereotype actually a parasitic infection?

## 2. Manipulation
It proves that behavior is not purely "Free Will".
A microscopic organism can rewire the fear circuits of a mammal.
We are chemical machines, and we can be hacked.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Toxoplasmosis** is a parasitic infection caused by *Toxoplasma gondii*. While its primary host is the domestic cat, it infects virtually all warm-blooded animals. In mice, it creates **Fatal Attraction** (removing the fear of cats). In humans, latent infection has been correlated (controversially) with increased risk-taking behavior, traffic accidents, and certain psychiatric disorders.

## Introduction: Hydrophobia
Rabies is slow. It travels up your nerves to the brain (1cm per day).
Once it hits the brain, you are dead.
It rewires you to spread it.
It causes **Hydrophobia** (Fear of Water).
Why? Because swallowing washes away the virus in your saliva.
The virus creates painful throat spasms so you *can't* swallow.
You drool (foaming at the mouth) which is full of virus, ready to bite.

## 1. The Milwaukee Protocol
For 4,000 years, a Rabies diagnosis was a death sentence.
In 2004, Jeanna Giese survived.
Types doctors put her in a coma to shut down her brain while her immune system fought.
It worked.
But it rarely works again.
The vaccine (Pasteur) only works *before* symptoms start.

## 2. Vampires
Rabies is likely the origin of Vampire and Werewolf myths.
Biting. Sensitivity to light. Fear of water (Holy Water?).
It turns a human into a monster.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Rabies** is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. It is unique for its **100% Fatality Rate** once symptoms appear. The virus manipulates the host's behavior (aggression, hydrophobia) to maximize transmission via saliva (biting). Post-exposure vaccination is the only cure.

## Introduction: The Eraser
Smallpox didn't just kill you (30% mortality). It erased you.
Survivors were left blind or horribly scarred.
It wiped out 90% of Native Americans before the Pilgrims even landed.
It was the heavy artillery of Evolution.

## 1. Variolation to Vaccination
Ancient Chinese doctors blew smallpox scabs up people's noses (Variolation). It was risky.
Edward Jenner noticed milkmaids didn't get Smallpox. They got **Cowpox** (mild).
He injected a boy with Cowpox. Then he exposed him to Smallpox.
The boy lived.
**Vaccination** (Vacca = Cow) was born.

## 2. Eradication
In 1967, the WHO decided to kill the virus.
They didn't vaccinate everyone (too expensive).
They used **Ring Vaccination**: Find a case, vaccinate everyone heavily around them. Starve the fire.
In 1977, Ali Maow Maalin in Somalia was the last natural case.
Smallpox is dead. (Except for two vials in freezers in the US and Russia).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Smallpox** was an infectious disease caused by the Variola virus. It was one of the deadliest diseases in human history, killing hundreds of millions. Through a massive global vaccination campaign led by the WHO, it was declared **Eradicated** in 1980—the first and only human disease to be driven to extinction by deliberate human effort.

## Introduction: The Miracle
Before antibiotics, a scratch from a rose thorn could kill you (Sepsis).
Alexander Fleming found Penicillin (Mold juice).
Suddenly, surgery was safe. Childbirth was safe.
We got cocky. We used antibiotics for everything (mostly feeding cows to make them fat).

## 1. Natural Selection
Bacteria multiply every 20 minutes.
If you kill 99.9% of them, the 0.1% that survive are **Immune**.
They multiply. Now you have a Superbug (MRSA).
We invent a stronger antibiotic. They evolve again.
It is an arms race. And we are losing.

## 2. The Cliff
We haven't discovered a new class of antibiotics in decades.
If we run out, we go back to the Dark Ages.
A C-Section or Hip Replacement becomes a life-threatening gamble.
The UN predicts Superbugs could kill 10 million people a year by 2050.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Antibiotic Resistance** occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to withstand the drugs designed to kill them. Driven by the overuse of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture, "Superbugs" like **MRSA** are becoming untreatable. This threatens to return humanity to a pre-antibiotic era where common infections and minor surgeries are once again fatal.
