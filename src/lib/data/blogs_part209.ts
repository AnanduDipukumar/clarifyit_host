## Introduction: The Race to the Sea
In 1914, everyone thought the war would be over by Christmas.
Everyone moved fast.
Then, they met the Machine Gun.
A single machine gun could stop a thousand men.
Nobody could advance. So they dug holes to hide.
Soon, a line of trenches stretched from Switzerland to the Sea.
The **Stalemate** began.

## 1. Life in the Mud
Rats the size of cats. Trench Foot (rot). Mustard Gas.
Artillery shelled them 24/7 (Shell Shock).
"Going over the top": The whistle blows. You climb out. You run at the machine guns. You die.
Gains were measured in inches.
The Battle of the Somme: 1 million casualties for 6 miles of land.

## 2. Breaking the Deadlock
The tank ended the trench.
It could roll over barbed wire and ignore bullets.
But for 4 years, technology (Defense) was stronger than tactics (Offense).
It was the first Industrial War.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Trench Warfare** is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines largely comprising military trenches, in which troops are well-protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. It became the defining characteristic of **World War I**, creating a bloody stalemate where "No Man's Land" was impassable due to machine guns and barbed wire.

## Introduction: Speed
The French built the Maginot Line (Super Trenches). They prepared for WWI Part 2.
The Germans brought Radios and Tanks.
**Blitzkrieg** (Lightning War) is:
1.  **Concentration:** Punch a hole in the line with all your tanks.
2.  **Speed:** Drive behind the enemy. Cut their supply lines.
3.  **Coordination:** Tanks talk to Planes (Luftwaffe) via radio.

## 1. The Ghost Division
Rommel drove his tanks so fast that even the German High Command didn't know where he was.
The French army was bigger and had better tanks.
But they moved at the speed of letters. The Germans moved at the speed of radio.
France collapsed in 46 days.

## 2. The Weakness
Blitzkrieg relies on fuel.
If you run out of gas, your tanks are just metal boxes.
Germany eventually lost because they stretched too far (Russia) and ran out of oil.
Speed kills, but Logistics wins wars.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Blitzkrieg** is a military tactic calculated to create psychological shock and resultant disorganization in enemy forces through the employment of surprise, speed, and superior firepower. It integrates tanks, air support, and motorized infantry to break through lines and encircle the enemy, avoiding static trench warfare.

## Introduction: Nash Equilibrium
If I have a nuke, and you have a stick -> I win.
If I have a nuke, and you have a nuke -> Nobody wins.
**Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)** is the doctrine that if two sides use nuclear weapons, both will be annihilated.
Therefore, neither side will fire.
It is a **Suicide Pact**.

## 1. Second Strike Capability
MAD only works if you can shoot back *after* you die.
If I nuke your silos, can you still kill me?
This is why we have **Nuclear Submarines**.
They hide in the ocean. Even if the USA is glassed, the subs will surface and destroy Russia.
This guarantees that a First Strike is suicide.

## 2. The Long Peace
It sounds insane.
But it worked.
The Cold War stayed "Cold" because Hot War meant extinction.
We are living in the most peaceful era in history, largely thanks to the threat of Armageddon.
The only risk: A mistake (or a madman who doesn't care about dying).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)** is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It creates a **Nash Equilibrium** where the only winning move is not to play.

## Introduction: Asymmetry
How did Vietnamese farmers defeat the US Military?
How did the Taliban defeat the USSR and NATO?
They didn't fight "Fair".
**Guerilla Warfare** is the weapon of the weak against the strong.
Rule 1: Never stand and fight.
Rule 2: Hit and run.
Rule 3: Blend in with civilians.

## 1. Political Will
The Guerilla doesn't need to win battles.
They just need to **Not Lose**.
The Superpower spends billions. The Guerilla spends pennies.
Eventually, the Superpower gets tired. Voters get angry. They leave.
The Guerilla wins by **Time**.
"You have the watches, but we have the time."

## 2. No Front Line
In conventional war, you take territory.
In Guerilla war, the enemy is everywhere and nowhere.
Every bush could be a trap.
This creates psychological terror in the occupying force.
It is impossible to defeat an enemy you cannot distinguish from the population.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Guerilla Warfare** is a form of irregular warfare in which small groups of combatants (paramilitary personnel, armed civilians) use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, and hit-and-run techniques to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military. It focuses on destroying the enemy's logistics and political will rather than their main army.

## Introduction: Operation Olympic Games
In 2010, Iranian nuclear centrifuges started exploding.
The scientists were confused. The indicators said everything was fine.
They were victims of the world's first **Cyber Weapon**: **Stuxnet**.
Allegedly built by the US and Israel.

## 1. Physical Damage
Before Stuxnet, viruses stole data (Credit Cards).
Stuxnet broke hardware.
It infected the PLC (controllers) of the centrifuges.
It spun them too fast (to break them) while telling the monitors "Speed: Normal".
It was huge. It proved that Code can kill Machines.

## 2. The New Battlefield
Future wars will start with the lights going out.
Hacking power grids, banks, and water plants.
It is cheap. It is anonymous (Proxy Servers).
You don't need a bomber; you need a zero-day exploit.
The "Fifth Domain" of warfare (Land, Sea, Air, Space, Cyber) is now the most active.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Cyber Warfare** involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks. **Stuxnet** (2010) was a turning point—a malicious worm that targeted SCADA systems and physically destroyed Iranian nuclear enrichment centrifuges, proving that cyberattacks can cause kinetic damage.
