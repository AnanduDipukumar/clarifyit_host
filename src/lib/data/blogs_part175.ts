## Introduction: The Shield
On Mars, there is a mountain.
It is **21.9 km** high (72,000 ft).
Everest is only 8.8 km.
It is so wide (600 km) that it would cover the entire country of France.
It is called **Olympus Mons**.

## 1. Why is it so big?
Volcanoes on Earth (like Hawaii) form over "Hotspots".
But Earth's crust moves (Tectonics).
The crust moves over the hotspot, creating a chain of small islands (Hawaii, Maui, Oahu).
Mars has **No Tectonics**. The crust doesn't move.
So the volcano just sat over the hotspot for millions of years.
It just kept growing. And growing. And growing.

> **Mental Model: Gravity Tax**
> Why can't mountains on Earth be this big?
> Gravity.
> If you pile too much rock on Earth, the base gets crushed and melts back into the mantle.
> Mars has lower gravity (38% of Earth).
> Lower gravity allows you to build taller structures before they collapse under their own weight.

## 2. Standing on the Summit
If you climbed to the top... the view would be boring.
The mountain is so wide that the slope is very gentle (only 5 degrees).
It would look like a flat plain.
You wouldn't even see the base; it would be over the horizon.
But the air pressure is interesting.
At the summit, the atmospheric pressure is partially vacuum.
You are high enough that you are effectively in space. The sky would be pitch black at noon.

## 3. Is it Dead?
We used to think Mars was geologically dead.
But recent radar scans suggest there might still be magma pockets deep underground.
Some lava flows look "young" (only 20 million years old).
Olympus Mons might just be sleeping.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Olympus Mons** is a shield volcano on Mars and the largest mountain in the solar system. Its immense size (3x Everest) is due to Mars' **Low Gravity** and lack of **Plate Tectonics**, which allowed lava to pile up in one spot for eons. It stands as a monument to the different geological history of the Red Planet.

## Introduction: The Eye
Galileo might have seen it. Cassini definitely saw it in 1665.
A giant red eye looking back at us.
**The Great Red Spot**.
It is an anticyclonic storm (high pressure) spinning counter-clockwise.
You could fit **1.3 Earths** inside it.

## 1. Why is it Red?
We actually don't know exactly.
Jupiter's clouds are Ammonia (White) and Sulfur (Yellow).
The Red is likely "sunburn".
UV light from the Sun hits the chemicals (Phosphine or Acetylene) in the upper atmosphere and cooks them into a reddish smog.
It's a skin rash on a planet.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Winds:** The winds at the edge of the spot blow at **430 km/h** (260 mph).
> That creates tremendous heat.
> The upper atmosphere above the spot is surprisingly hot (1300°C), likely from gravity waves and sound waves crashing from the storm below. It acts like a giant speaker blasting heat into space.

## 2. Why doesn't it stop?
Hurricanes on Earth die when they hit land. (Friction/No fuel).
Jupiter has **No Land**. It is gas all the way down.
There is nothing to slow the storm down.
It eats smaller storms to stay part.
It is arguably the most stable weather system in the solar system.

## 3. It is Shrinking
Since 1900, it has been getting smaller.
It used to be oval. Now it's round.
It is shrinking at a rate of 900 km per year.
Some scientists think it might disappear in our lifetime (next 20 years).
Others think it interacts with the heat from below and will stabilize.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Great Red Spot** is a persistent high-pressure storm on Jupiter, larger than Earth and centuries old. Its longevity is due to the lack of **Solid Ground** to dissipate its energy via friction. However, recent observations show it is **Shrinking**, raising the possibility that we are witnessing the end of one of the solar system's most iconic features.

        description: "Venus should be Earth's twin. Instead, it is 460°C and rains sulfuric acid. It is the ultimate warning about climate feedback loops.",

## Introduction: The Twin
Venus is the same size as Earth. Same gravity. Made of the same stuff.
It is in the "Goldilocks Zone" (mostly).
In the 1900s, Sci-Fi writers thought it was a jungle planet.
Then we sent a probe (Mariner 2).
It measured the temperature: **462°C (864°F)**.
Hotter than Mercury (which is closer to the Sun).
Lead melts on the surface.

## 1. What happened?
We think Venus used to have oceans.
But it was slightly closer to the Sun.
As the Sun got brighter, the oceans evaporated.
Water vapor is a Greenhouse Gas.
More heat -> More evaporation -> More heat.
This is a **Positive Feedback Loop**.
The oceans boiled away.
Then the volcanoes erupted, pumping CO2.
Without oceans to absorb the CO2 (like Earth does with limestone), the CO2 stayed in the air.
Atmosphere became 96% CO2. Pressure became 90x Earth.

> **Mental Model: The Blanket**
> Imagine you have 1 blanket. You are warm.
> Add 90 blankets. You die of heatstroke.
> Venus has a CO2 blanket 90 times thicker than Earth's atmosphere.
> It traps *all* the heat.

## 2. The Surface (Venera)
The Russians landed probes (Venera) in the 70s and 80s.
Most melted in minutes.
Venera 13 lasted 127 minutes.
It sent back the only photos we have from the surface.
Yellow sky. Crushed rocks. Hell.

## 3. The Warning
Venus is Earth's "Ghost of Christmas Future".
It shows that climate stability is fragile.
Once a **Runaway Greenhouse Effect** starts, you cannot stop it.
Earth recycles its Carbon (Plate Tectonics/Oceans). Venus couldn't.
We are lucky. But we shouldn't push our luck.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Venus** suffered a **Runaway Greenhouse Effect**. Billions of years ago, rising solar heat evaporated its oceans. Without water to absorb carbon, volcanic CO2 built up in the atmosphere, creating a thermal blanket that raised temperatures to 462°C. It serves as a planetary laboratory for **Climate Feedback Loops**, demonstrating how a habitable world can turn into an oven.

## Introduction: The Orange Fog
Titan is bigger than Mercury.
If it orbited the Sun, it would be a planet.
It is covered in thick orange smog (Nitrogen and Hydrocarbons).
We couldn't see the surface.
So we sent a robot: **Cassini-Huygens** (2005).

## 1. The Landing
The Huygens probe parachuted down.
It saw hills. Valleys. River deltas.
It landed with a *squelch*.
It was landing on mud.
But at -179°C, water is rock hard (ice).
The "Rocks" were ice. The "Water" was **Liquid Methane** (Natural Gas).

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Lower Gravity + Thick Air:** Titan has low gravity (14% of Earth) but very thick air (1.5x Earth pressure).
> This means if you strapped wings to your arms... you could flap and fly like a bird.
> It is the only place in the solar system where distinct human-powered flight is possible.

## 2. The Methane Cycle
Titan has a weather cycle just like Earth.
Sun heats Methane Ocean -> Methane Clouds -> Methane Rain -> Methane Rivers.
**Kraken Mare** is a huge sea of methane near the north pole.
It is literally a lake of gasoline.
If you lit a match... nothing would happen. (No Oxygen).

## 3. Weird Life?
Could life exist there?
Not Earth life (we need water).
But maybe "Methanogenic" life?
Life that drinks hydrogen and breathes methane?
In 2027, NASA is launching **Dragonfly**.
A nuclear-powered drone that will fly around Titan looking for life.
It is the coolest mission ever planned.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Titan** is Saturn's largest moon and the most Earth-like world we have found, possessing a dense nitrogen atmosphere and a complete liquid cycle. However, its "Water" is liquid **Methane** and **Ethane** due to the frigid -179°C temperatures. It remains a prime candidate for **Exotic Life** that might operate on chemistry fundamentally different from our own.

## Introduction: The Tug of War
Gravity holds a moon together.
But if a moon gets too close to a planet, the planet pulls harder on the *front* of the moon than the *back*.
This is a **Tidal Force**.
If the Tidal Force > The Moon's Gravity...
**SNAP.**
The moon disintegrates.

## 1. Saturn's Rings
This happened to Saturn.
About 100 million years ago (very recent!), an icy moon (let's call it "Veritas") wandered too close.
It crossed the **Roche Limit**.
Saturn ripped it into trillions of pieces.
Those pieces spread out into a flat disk.
That is what the Rings are: A Graveyard.

> **Mental Model: The Spaghetti Effect**
> This is the same physics as **Spaghettification** near a Black Hole.
> If you fall feet first, your feet are pulled harder than your head.
> You stretch.
> The Roche Limit is just the point where that stretching exceeds your internal strength.

## 2. Phobos is Doomed
Mars has a moon called **Phobos**.
It is spiraling inward.
In about 30 million years, it will cross the Roche Limit.
Mars will tear it apart.
Mars will get a ring system (briefly).
Then the pieces will crash down as a meteor shower.

## 3. Earth's Roche Limit
Earth has a Roche limit too (about 18,000 km).
The Moon is safely far away (384,000 km).
BUT... artificial satellites are inside the limit.
Why don't they break?
Because they are held together by **Bolts and Glue** (Electromagnetic forces), not Gravity.
The Roche Limit only applies to things held together by their own gravity (moons/stars).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Roche Limit** is the minimum distance a satellite can approach its primary body without being torn apart by **Tidal Forces**. Saturn's **Rings** are the debris of a moon that crossed this line and was pulverized. It explains why large moons generally orbit far away, while rings orbit close in.
