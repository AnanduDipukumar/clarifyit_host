## Introduction: The Hundred Days
Napoleon had escaped exile. He marched on Paris.
The King fled. The Emperor was back.
He had 100 days to rebuild his army and strike before the rest of Europe could unite.
He marched north to Belgium.
Waiting for him was the Duke of Wellington (British) and Blücher (Prussian).
The battle happened on a muddy field near Waterloo.

> **Common Misconception: "Napoleon was short."**
> He was 5'6" (Average for the time).
> The confusion came because French "Feet" were longer than English "Feet".
> Also, his bodyguards were giants, making him look small.
> The "Napoleon Complex" is based on a unit conversion error.

## 1. The Mud
It rained all night.
This was critical.
Napoleon's strength was his Artillery (Cannons).
But you cannot skip cannonballs on soft mud. They just splat.
He had to wait until noon for the ground to dry.
That delay gave the Prussians time to arrive.
Nature defeated the greatest general in history.

## 2. The Squares
The French Cavalry charged the British Infantry.
Usually, horses trample men.
But the British formed **Infantry Squares**.
Walls of bayonets.
The horses refused to charge into the spikes.
The French rode around the squares, getting shot to pieces.
"They came on in the same old style, and we drove them off in the same old style."

## 3. The Arrival of Blücher
By late afternoon, Wellington was losing.
"Give me night, or give me Blücher."
Then, black uniforms appeared on the horizon.
The Prussians had arrived.
They hit Napoleon's flank.
The French Imperial Guard—who had never retreated—broke.
Chaos.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> **The Battle of Waterloo (1815)** marked the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. A combination of **rain** (which delayed French artillery), British **defensive tactics** (Infantry Squares), and the timely arrival of the **Prussian Army** sealed his fate. It ended 23 years of war and established the British Empire as the dominant global power for the next century.

## Introduction: The Telescope
In 1610, Galileo pointed a telescope at Jupiter.
He saw 4 moons orbiting it.
This broke Aristotle's Physics: "Everything orbits the Earth."
If moons orbit Jupiter... maybe Earth orbits the Sun?
Copernicus said it first, but Galileo had **Proof**.

## 1. The Conflict
Pope Urban VIII was actually Galileo's friend.
He let him write a book about it, *if* he treated it as a "Theory".
Galileo wrote *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*.
In the book, he put the Pope's arguments into the mouth of a character named **Simplicio** (The Idiot).
The Pope was not amused.
It wasn't just Science; it was Politics.
The Protestant Reformation was happening. The Church couldn't look weak.

> **Mental Model: Paradigm Shift**
> Thomas Kuhn coined "Paradigm Shift" to describe this.
> Science doesn't progress smoothly. It jumps.
> Normal Science -> Anomalies (Jupiter's Moons) -> Crisis -> Revolution -> New Paradigm.
> The Church was defending the Old Paradigm (Geocentrism). Galileo was the Revolution.

## 2. The Trial
Galileo was dragged before the Inquisition.
They threatened him with torture.
He was 69 years old.
He recanted. "I abjure, curse and detest my errors."
He admitted the Earth was the center of the universe to save his life.
Legend says as he stood up, he muttered: ***"Eppur si muove"*** (And yet it moves).

## 3. House Arrest
He wasn't burned at the stake.
He was locked in his villa in Florence.
He went blind.
But he kept working. He wrote *Two New Sciences* (the foundation of Kinematics/Physics).
He smuggled the manuscript to Holland to be published.
You can imprison the man, but not the math.


> **Why This Is Counterintuitive**
> It feels like the Earth is still.
> If we are spinning at 1000 mph, why don't we fly off?
> (Answer: Gravity).
> Our senses lie to us. The Sun *looks* like it rises.
> Science is the art of ignoring "Common Sense" in favor of Evidence.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Trial of Galileo** was the defining clash between Authority and Observation. Galileo used the telescope to prove **Heliocentrism**, contradicting the Church's interpretation of Scripture. His conviction for heresy chilled Italian science for centuries, shifting the center of the Scientific Revolution to Northern Europe (Newton, Hooke). It stands as a warning that power often fears truth.

## Introduction: The Tinderbox
London in 1666 was made of wood and pitch.
Streets were narrow. Houses touched each other.
It had been a hot, dry summer.
On September 2nd, Thomas Farriner's bakery on Pudding Lane caught fire.

## 1. The Spread
The Mayor, Thomas Bloodworth, was woken up.
He looked at the fire and said: "Pish! A woman might piss it out."
He went back to bed.
By morning, it was an inferno.
The wind blew it west.
People fled into the Thames river.
St. Paul's Cathedral—which was wrapped in wooden scaffolding—caught fire. The lead roof melted and flowed down the streets like lava.

## 2. The Firebreak
You stop a fire by starving it.
King Charles II ordered houses to be blown up with gunpowder to create a gap.
The fire stopped.
**Casualties:** Officially, only 6 people died.
**Reality:** Likely thousands of poor people died and were cremated by the heat, unrecorded.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Insurance:** The Fire created the Insurance Industry.
> Nicholas Barbon founded the "Fire Office".
> They gave you a metal badge (Fire Mark) to put on your house.
> If your house caught fire, the private Fire Brigade would come.
> If you didn't have a badge... they would let it burn.

## 3. The Rebirth (Wren)
Christopher Wren rebuilt the city.
He wanted a grid system (like New York).
Property owners reused. "This is *my* plot of land."
So the streets remained twisty.
But the houses were built of **Brick and Stone**.
It ended the Medieval city and created the Modern one.
Also... it killed the rats. The Fire ended the Great Plague of London (1665).


> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Great Fire of London (1666)** destroyed 80% of the city. While a disaster, it cleansed the city of the Bubonic Plague (by killing rats) and allowed for a Modern, brick-based reconstruction led by **Christopher Wren**. It also birthed the modern Property Insurance industry. It proved that sometimes a system needs to burn down to be fixed.

## Introduction: Taxation Without Representation
Britain was broke after fighting France (Seven Years' War).
They taxed the Colonies to pay for it.
Stamp Act. Sugar Act. Townshend Acts.
The Americans hated it. "We have no MP in Parliament. You can't tax us."
Britain repealed most taxes... except on **Tea**.
To prove a point.

## 1. The Monopoly
The British East India Company was failing.
Parliament gave them a Monopoly to sell tea in America tax-free (undercutting local smugglers).
It wasn't that the tea was expensive. It was actually *cheaper*.
But it was the *principle*.
If we accept this monopoly, we accept Parliament's right to control us.

## 2. The Night
December 16, 1773.
Samuel Adams signaled the meeting.
Men dressed as Mohawk Warriors boarded the ships (*Dartmouth, Eleanor, Beaver*).
They smashed 342 chests of tea and threw them into the harbor.
Value: $1.7 Million today.
They didn't steal anything. They even swept the decks after.
It was a political protest, not a riot.

> **Mental Model: Accelerationalism**
> The Tea Party was an accelerant.
> Radicals like Sam Adams *wanted* the British to overreact.
> By provoking a harsh crackdown, they forced the moderates to choose a side.
> "The King has revealed his tyranny."

## 3. The Empire Strikes Back
King George III was furious.
He passed the **Intolerable Acts**:
1.  Closed Boston Harbor.
2.  Martial Law.
This backfired.
Instead of isolating Boston, it united the colonies.
"If they can do it to Boston, they can do it to Virginia."
The First Continental Congress met. War was inevitable.


> **Common Misconception: "They hated high taxes."**
> Taxes in America were lower than in Britain.
> They hated the **Lack of Consent**.
> It was about Sovereignty, not money.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Boston Tea Party** was a calculated act of sabotage against the British East India Company's monopoly. It triggered the **Intolerable Acts**, which united the 13 Colonies against the Crown. It demonstrates that revolutions are often sparked not by suffering (the tea was cheap), but by symbolic violations of rights.

## Introduction: King John (The Worst King)
King John was terrible.
He lost Normandy to the French (hence "John Lackland").
He taxed the Barons to death to pay for his wars.
He slept with their wives.
The Barons had enough. They captured London.
They forced him to negotiate.

## 1. The Document
Magna Carta (Latin for Great Charter).
It had 63 clauses.
Most were boring (about fishing rights and inheritance tax).
But **Clause 39** changed the world:
"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."
**Habeas Corpus.** No imprisonment without trial.
**Rule of Law.** The King is not God. He is subject to the law.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Only 4 Copies Remain:** It was written on sheepskin parchment.
> Only 4 originals from 1215 survive.
> When the US Founding Fathers wrote the Bill of Rights, they literally copied phrases from it.
> "Due Process" is a 500-year-old idea.

## 2. The Betrayal
King John signed it.
Then he immediately emailed the Pope: "These guys bullied me. Cancel it."
The Pope annulled it.
Civil War started.
John died of dysentery a year later.
His son (Henry III) re-issued it to get the Barons on his side.
It became the bedrock of English Law.

## 3. The Legacy
The US Constitution is based on it.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is based on it.
It shifted power from **One** (Monarchy) to **Few** (Oligarchy/Barons).
Eventually, it shifted to **Many** (Democracy).
It started the slow death of Absolutism.


> **Where This Breaks Down**
> "No Free Man."
> In 1215, most people were Serfs (Slaves). They were not "Free Men".
> Magna Carta only helped the Rich Barons.
> It took another 700 years for it to apply to peasants, women, and minorities.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Magna Carta (1215)** established the principle that **The King is not above the Law**. While originally a peace treaty between King John and rebellious barons, its guarantees of **Trial by Jury** and **Due Process** became the foundation of modern democracy and the US Constitution. It broke the spell of Divine Right.
