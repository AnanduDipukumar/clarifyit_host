## Introduction: The Angel
You see a tall, handsome man in a suit.
You instantly assume he is:
1.  Rich.
2.  Smart.
3.  Trustworthy.
This is the **Halo Effect**.
It is the tendency for one positive trait (Beauty) to "spill over" into other unrelated traits (Intelligence/Morality).

## 1. The Courtroom
It is unfair.
In courtrooms, attractive defendants get lighter sentences.
In schools, attractive children get better grades for the same work.
In politics, closer to the "Ideal Height" usually wins.
We conflate "Good Looking" with "Good".
This is why villains in old Disney movies were ugly, and heroes were beautiful.

## 2. The Reverse Halo (Horns Effect)
It works the other way too.
If someone is short, overweight, or poorly dressed, we unconsciously assume they are lazy or stupid.
This is the **Horns Effect**.
It is a mental shortcut to save energy, but it ruins hiring decisions and judicial fairness.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Halo Effect** is a cognitive bias where the perception of one positive trait in a person or object (like attractiveness) influences the perception of other positive traits (like intelligence or kindness). It creates a "Halo" that blinds us to their flaws. It explains why celebrity endorsements work and why first impressions are so difficult to overcome.

## Introduction: Easy Recall
What kills more people?
A) Sharks.
B) Cows.
Answer: Cows (approx 20x more).
But you can't remember a movie about a killer cow.
You *can* remember Jaws.
The **Availability Heuristic** says: "If I can remember it easily, it must be likely."

## 1. The News Filter
The News only reports rare events (Plane crashes, Murder).
It never reports common events ("Man dies of heart attack").
So your brain thinks:
"I see plane crashes on TV all the time -> Plane crashes are common."
"I never see heart attacks on TV -> Heart attacks are rare."
This makes us panic about the wrong things.

## 2. Impact
We spend billions fighting Terrorism (low risk).
We spend pennies fighting Heart Disease (high risk).
We drive to avoid flying (and die in car crashes).
Our internal Risk Calculator is broken because it runs on *Stories*, not *Data*.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Availability Heuristic** is a mental shortcut where people judge the probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Events that are emotional, vivid, or recent (like Shark Attacks or Lottery Wins) are recalled more easily than mundane, high-probability events (like Car Crashes), leading to distorted risk assessment.

## Introduction: Sticks and Stones
You get a performance review.
"Great work. Punctual. Creative. Just one thing... try to proofread more."
You go home. Do you think about the 3 compliments?
No. You obsess over the proofreading comment.
"He hates me. I'm getting fired."
This is **Negativity Bias**.
Positive events stick like Teflon. Negative events stick like Velcro.

## 1. Evolution
Why?
If you miss a piece of fruit (Positive), you are hungry for a few hours.
If you miss a tiger (Negative), you are dead.
Nature prioritized "Threat Detection" over "Happiness".
A brain that ignored bad news didn't pass on its genes.

## 2. In Relationships
Dr. John Gottman found the "Magic Ratio".
You need **5 Positive interactions** to cancel out **1 Negative interaction**.
If the ratio drops below 5:1, the relationship usually ends.
Bad is stronger than Good.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Negativity Bias** is the psychological phenomenon where negative events, emotions, or feedback possess a greater impact on our psychological state than positive ones of equal intensity. We pay more attention to threats and insults because, evolutionarily, ignoring a threat was fatal, while ignoring a reward was merely inconvenient.

        description: "We overvalue things we built ourselves. Why cake mixes used to fail until they made you add an egg.",

## Introduction: Do It Yourself
You buy a table from IKEA.
You spend 4 hours cursing, sweating, and losing screws.
It's a bit crooked.
But when friends come over, you say: "I love this table."
If you bought it pre-assembled, you wouldn't care.
This is the **IKEA Effect**.
Labor leads to Love.

## 1. The Egg Theory
In the 1950s, instant cake mixes failed.
They were too easy. "Just add water."
Housewives felt guilty. It didn't feel like cooking.
So the company removed the powdered egg. "Just add water *and an egg*."
Sales exploded.
By adding labor, the customer felt ownership. It became *their* cake.

## 2. Business
Smart companies make you work a little.
*   **Build-a-Bear:** Paying for a teddy bear is $10. Paying to *stuff* it yourself is $30.
*   **HelloFresh:** You cook it yourself, so you value the meal more.
Competence creates value.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **IKEA Effect** is a cognitive bias where consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. The effort invested creates a sense of ownership and competence. It explains why DIY projects often feel more satisfying than higher-quality pre-made goods, provided the task is successfully completed.

## Introduction: "Just 5 Minutes"
"I'll write this paper in a day." (Takes a week).
"We'll build this airport in 3 years." (Takes 8).
This is the **Planning Fallacy**.
We assume the **Best Case Scenario**.
We ignore: sickness, traffic, computer crashes, changing requirements.

## 1. The Sydney Opera House
Budget: $7 Million. Time: 4 Years.
Actual: $102 Million. Time: 14 Years.
This isn't an exception; it is the rule.
Human brains cannot forecast friction.
We imagine a straight line from A to B.
Reality is a squiggly line.

## 2. How to fix it
**Reference Class Forecasting:**
Don't look at *your* plan.
Look at *similar projects* in the past.
"How long did the last 5 airports take?"
"Average: 7 years."
Then your prediction should be 7 years.
Ignore your optimism. Trust the data.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Planning Fallacy** (Daniel Kahneman) is the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits. It arises from **Optimism Bias** and focusing on the specific details of the project rather than the statistical distribution of similar past projects (**The Outside View**).
