## Introduction: The Race
In 1911, the South Pole was the last prize on Earth.
Two men went for it.
**Robert Falcon Scott** (British Navy): Brought ponies, motorized sleds, and wool coats.
**Roald Amundsen** (Norwegian): Brought dogs, skis, and fur.

## 1. Preparation
Amundsen lived with the Inuit. He learned that dogs eat seal blubber (energy) and that motorized sleds break.
He planned everything to the ounce.
He treated it like a logistic operation, not a heroic adventure.
He arrived at the Pole on December 14, 1911.
He planted the flag, left a nice letter for Scott, and skied home gaining weight because he had so much food.

## 2. The Tragedy
Scott arrived 34 days later. He found the Norwegian flag.
"Great God! This is an awful place," he wrote.
On the way back, his team starved and froze to death just 11 miles from a food depot.
Amundsen proved that "Adventure is just bad planning."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Roald Amundsen** became the first person to reach the South Pole in 1911. His success over the rival British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott is attributed to his superior preparation and adoption of Inuit survival techniques (fur clothing, dog sleds) compared to Scott's reliance on unproven technology (motor sledges) and ponies.

## Introduction: The Blank Map
In 1768, the map of the Pacific was blank.
People thought there was a massive continent at the bottom of the world ("Terra Australis") to balance the land in the North.
**James Cook** was sent to find it.

## 1. Scurvy
Sailors used to die by the thousands from **Scurvy** (Vitamin C deficiency).
Cook was a fanatic about hygiene and diet. He forced his men to eat Sauerkraut.
He was the first captain to lose almost no men to disease.
This allowed him to sail longer than anyone else.

## 2. Contact
He mapped New Zealand, the East Coast of Australia, and Hawaii.
He essentially drew the modern map of the Pacific.
But first contact is dangerous.
In 1779, he tried to kidnap the King of Hawaii after a dispute over a stolen boat.
The Hawaiians fought back, and Cook was killed on the beach.
It was a violent end to the greatest navigator in history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Captain James Cook** made three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, achieving the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. He revolutionized naval exploration by conquering **Scurvy** through dietary mandates (Sauerkraut), allowing ships to stay at sea for years and map the globe with unprecedented accuracy.

## Introduction: The Stunt
Nellie Bly was already famous for feigning insanity to expose a brutal asylum.
In 1889, she told her editor at *The New York World*: "I can beat Phileas Fogg (the fictional character)."
She refused to take 20 trunks like a "lady." She took one handbag.

## 1. The Journey
She traveled by steamship, train, and rickshaw.
She met Jules Verne in France (he said she wouldn't make it).
She bought a monkey in Singapore.
She raced against a rival reporter from *Cosmopolitan* who went the other way.

## 2. The Result
She arrived back in New Jersey in **72 Days, 6 Hours, and 11 Minutes**.
She set a world record.
She proved that a woman could travel alone without a chaperone and that the world was becoming smaller.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Nellie Bly** was a pioneering investigative journalist who achieved global fame for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days (beating the fictional record of 80 days). Her journey in 1889-1890 demonstrated the feasibility of global travel and challenged Victorian gender norms regarding women's independence and capability.

## Introduction: The Companion
**Charles Darwin** wasn't the ship's official naturalist. He was just a rich kid invited to keep the Captain company so he wouldn't go crazy.
The Captain (FitzRoy) was a devout creationist.
They spent 5 years arguing in a tiny cabin.

## 1. The Galapagos
Darwin noticed that the finches on one island had thick beaks (for cracking nuts), and finches on another had thin beaks (for catching bugs).
They were the same bird, but adapted to their environment.
He realized species weren't fixed. They changed.

## 2. The Delay
He didn't publish his theory for 20 years. He was terrified of the backlash.
But looking back, the voyage of the Beagle is the most important scientific expedition in history.
It gave us **Natural Selection**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Voyage of the HMS Beagle** (1831–1836) carried Charles Darwin around the world. His observations of geology and biodiversity, particularly the distinct but related species on the **Galapagos Islands**, provided the foundational evidence for his theory of **Evolution by Natural Selection**, published decades later in *On the Origin of Species*.

## Introduction: The Third Pole
North Pole? Done. South Pole? Done.
Everest was the "Third Pole."
The air is so thin at 29,000 feet that your brain dies (The Death Zone).
The Swiss had failed the year before by just 800 feet.

## 1. The Team
The British expedition was massive (350 porters).
But the final push came down to two men:
**Edmund Hillary** (a kiwi beekeeper who possessed superhuman lung capacity).
**Tenzing Norgay** (the most experienced Sherpa in history).

## 2. The Summit
On May 29, 1953, they reached the top.
They stayed for 15 minutes.
Hillary took a picture of Tenzing holding his ice axe. Tenzing buried some chocolate in the snow as an offering.
They walked down as legends.
Hillary famously said: "Well, George, we knocked the bastard off."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Sir Edmund Hillary** and **Tenzing Norgay** achieved the first confirmed summit of **Mount Everest** on May 29, 1953. Their success relied on the use of closed-circuit oxygen systems and the logistical support of a massive British expedition. It marked the golden age of mountaineering and brought global recognition to the Sherpa people.
