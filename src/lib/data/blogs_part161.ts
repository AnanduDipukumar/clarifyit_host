## Introduction: The Bucket
Think of your camera sensor as a bucket collecting rain (Light).
You want the bucket exactly full (Perfect Exposure).
You have three ways to control it:
1.  **Aperture:** How wide the bucket opening is.
2.  **Shutter Speed:** How long you leave it out in the rain.
3.  **ISO:** Determining how magical the water is? (Okay, the analogy breaks here).

## 1. Aperture (f-stop)
The hole in the lens.
*   **Low Number (f/1.8):** Big Hole. Lots of light. Shallow depth of field (Blurry background/Bokeh). Great for portraits.
*   **High Number (f/16):** Tiny Hole. Less light. Deep depth of field (Everything depends on focus). Great for landscapes.
It controls **Depth**.

## 2. Shutter Speed (Time)
The curtain that covers the sensor.
*   **Fast (1/4000s):** Freezes a hummingbird wing.
*   **Slow (1/2s):** Blurs a waterfall into a silky river.
It controls **Motion**.
**The Reciprocal Rule:** If you are holding the camera, your shutter speed should be at least 1/Focal Length (e.g., 50mm lens = 1/60s) to avoid hand-shake blur.

## 3. ISO (Sensitivity)
This is actually **Gain**. It amplifies the signal.
*   **Low (ISO 100):** Clean signal. High quality.
*   **High (ISO 6400):** Amplified signal. Creates "Noise" (Static/Grain).
**ISO Invariance:** Modern sensors are so good that shooting at low ISO and brightening in post is almost the same as shooting high ISO.
Night photography is a war against Noise.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Sunny 16 Rule:**
> Before light meters, photographers memorized physics.
> "On a sunny day, set Aperture to **f/16** and Shutter Speed to **1/ISO**."
> So at ISO 100, shoot at 1/100s.
> It works perfectly every time. The sun is a consistent light bulb.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Exposure Triangle** is the balance of **Aperture** (Depth of Field), **Shutter Speed** (Motion), and **ISO** (Signal Gain). Changing one affects the others. A perfect photo requires balancing these three to get the right amount of light while achieving the artistic look (Blurry background vs Sharp landscape, Frozen action vs Motion blur) you desire.

        description: "Why are amateur photos boring? Because the subject is in the middle. The Rule of Thirds uses the way our eyes naturally scan an image to create dynamism.",

## Introduction: The Grid
Imagine a Tic-Tac-Toe board over your viewfinder.
Two vertical lines. Two horizontal lines.
**Place your subject on the intersections (Power Points).**
Never in the middle.
Why?

## 1. Dynamic Tension
The human eye hates symmetry (unless it is a **Wes Anderson** movie).
Symmetry feels static. Resolved. Boring.
Placing the subject off-center creates "Negative Space".
It forces the eye to bounce between the subject and the background.
It tells a story. "Here is the person... and here is where they are looking."

## 2. Leading Lines
Use the environment to point to the subject.
A road. A fence. A shadow. Receeding into the distance.
They act as an arrow.
Our eyes naturally follow lines to the Vanishing Point.
If you place the subject *on* that line, you control the viewer's gaze.

## 3. The Golden Ratio (Fibonacci)
The Rule of Thirds is actually the "Dumb Version" of the **Golden Ratio (1.618)**.
The Fibonacci Spiral.
It appears in nature (Nautilus shells, Galaxy spirals, Pinecones).
We are biologically programmed to find it beautiful.
Masters like **Henri Cartier-Bresson** composed intuitively with the Golden Ratio.
It feels "Balanced" without being symmetrical.

> **Mental Model: The Horizon**
>
> Never put the horizon in the middle (50/50).
> If the Sky is interesting, put the horizon on the **Bottom line** (giving the sky 2/3rds).
> If the Ground is interesting, put the horizon on the **Top line** (giving the ground 2/3rds).
> Make a choice. What is the photo about?

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Rule of Thirds** is a composition guideline that divides the frame into a 3x3 grid. Placing subjects on the **Intersections** or aligning horizons with the **Grid Lines** creates photos that are more energetic and balanced than center-composed shots. It works by utilizing **Negative Space** and leading the viewer's eye through the image, often approximating the mathematically pleasing **Golden Ratio**.

## Introduction: The Invisible Man
**Henri Cartier-Bresson**.
The father of Street Photography.
He didn't use flash. He didn't crop. He didn't pose people.
He walked around Paris with a tiny Leica, wrapped in black tape to be invisible.
His philosophy: **"There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture... The Decisive Moment."**

## 1. The Puddle Jumper (1932)
His most famous shot: *Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare*.
A man is jumping over a puddle.
He is suspended in mid-air.
His reflection mirrors him perfectly.
In the background, a poster of a dancer mimics his pose.
It happened in 1/100th of a second.
If HCB had clicked a moment later... the foot would splash. The magic would be gone.
It is the perfect alignment of Geometry and Chaos.

## 2. Anticipation vs Hunting
You don't chase a photo. You set a trap for it.
Bresson would find a beautiful background (The Stage).
Then he would wait.
He would wait for an hour for a cat, or a person, or a shadow to walk into the perfect spot.
**"Photography is not like painting. There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera."**

## 3. The Anti-Crop
Bresson hated cropping.
He believed the composition happened *in the viewfinder*.
To prove he didn't crop, he would print the **Black Borders** of the film negative in the final print.
It was a flex.
"I got this right the first time."

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Leica:** Before the Leica (1925), cameras were giant boxes on tripods.
> The Leica was small, fast, and silent.
> It allowed photography to become **Candid**.
> Without this German engineering, Street Photography wouldn't exist.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Decisive Moment** defines photography as the art of Timing. Unlike painting (where you construct the image), photography is about recognizing the precise millisecond when the chaos of reality organizes itself into a perfect geometric and emotional composition. **Henri Cartier-Bresson** mastered this by waiting patiently ("The Trap") and refusing to alter or crop the image afterwards—valuing the authenticity of the instant.

## Introduction: The Slow Down
Digital Photography is convenient. Instant. Free.
You take 1,000 photos. You look at none of them.
**Film** is expensive ($1 per shot). Limited (36 shots). Slow (Wait days for dev).
That is why it is better.
It forces **Intentionality**.
You have to *think* before you click.

## 1. The Chemistry (Silver Halide)
Film is covered in Silver Halide crystals.
When light hits them, it creates a "Latent Image".
Developer chemicals turn the exposed crystals into metallic silver (Black).
Digital sensors are a perfect grid of squares (Pixels).
Film grain is **Random**. Organic clumps.
Our brains prefer the chaos of grain. It feels "Alive". Pixels feel "Sterile".

## 2. Dynamic Range (The Highlight Roll-off)
Digital sensors (Linear) are bad at bright light.
If you overexpose a cloud on an iPhone... it turns Pure White. The data is deleted. Clipped.
Film (Logarithmic) handles light differently.
It retains detail in the bright spots.
The "Highlights roll off" gently.
This is why movies shot on Film (*Dunkirk*, *Oppenheimer*) look "Creamy" and dreamlike compared to sharp digital video.

## 3. The Imperfection
We live in a world of AI perfection and 8K screens.
We are starving for reality.
Film has **Light Leaks**. Dust. Color Shifts.
The mistakes make it feel real.
It is the "Wabi-Sabi" of imaging. Beauty in imperfection.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Kodachrome:** The most famous film ever made. Paul Simon wrote a song about it.
> It had vibrant, specific reds and yellows that digital cannot replicate.
> Kodak stopped making it in 2009.
> The last roll ever produced was given to Steve McCurry (who shot the *Afghan Girl*). He shot it in India.
> The colors are now extinct.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Analog Film** is experiencing a revival because its limitations (Cost, Speed, Scarcity) force photographers to be more artistic and intentional. Chemically, **Silver Halide** crystals provide a random "Grain" structure and superior **Dynamic Range** (Highlight handling) compared to the rigid grid of digital pixels. In an era of AI perfection, the organic imperfections ("Light Leaks") of film feel more authentic to the human eye.

## Introduction: Yosemite
Ansel Adams is the most famous landscape photographer in history.
His photos of Yosemite National Park look majestic. High contrast. Glowing peaks. Deep black shadows.
Here is the secret: **It didn't look like that in real life.**
Adams was a manipulator.

## 1. The Zone System
Adams was a nerd.
He invented a scientific scale for light.
**Zone 0** (Pure Black) to **Zone 10** (Pure White). **Zone 5** is Middle Gray (18% Gray card).
Before taking the photo, he would measure the shadow of a rock (Zone 2) and the light on the snow (Zone 8).
He would expose the film and *develop* it specifically to move those values to where he wanted them.
"Expose for the shadows, develop for the highlights."

## 2. Dodging and Burning (The Performance)
He famously said: **"The Negative is the Score. The Print is the Performance."**
In the darkroom, he played the light like a piano.
*   **Dodging:** Creating a shadow with his hand to block light from hitting the paper (Making an area Lighter).
*   **Burning:** Using a hole in a card to focus extra light on an area (Making it Darker).
He would darken the sky to make the moon pop (*Moonrise, Hernandez*).
He was "Photoshopping" with cardboard and physics 50 years before Adobe.

## 3. Conservation
His art had a purpose.
He sent his photos to Washington DC.
Congressmen used them as evidence to expand the National Parks system.
He proved that **Wilderness is an asset**.
"It is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit."

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Group f/64:** Adams founded a club called **f/64**.
> It refers to the smallest aperture on a lens.
> Using f/64 gives you Infinite Depth of Field. Everything from the grass at your feet to the mountain 10 miles away is razor sharp.
> It was a rebellion against "Pictorialism" (blurry, painting-like photos). They wanted "Straight Photography".

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ansel Adams** revolutionized photography by treating it as a rigorous science. He invented the **Zone System** to visualize and control the tonal range of black and white film (0-10 scale). His mastery of the Darkroom (**Dodging and Burning**) allowed him to manipulate contrast and mood, creating the iconic, dramatic images of the American West that helped convince the government to protect **National Parks**.
