## Introduction: Memory is Reconstruction
Your brain is not a video camera.
It is a Wikipedia page that *anyone can edit*.
Every time you remember something, you are re-writing the file.
You can insert details that weren't there.
Dr. Elizabeth Loftus proved she could plant a memory of "Getting lost in a mall" in participants' minds just by suggesting it.

## 1. The Mandela Effect
Thousands of people remember "Luke, I am your father."
The line is: "No, *I* am your father."
People remember Curious George with a tail (He has none).
This isn't a parallel universe. It's **Schema Theory**.
We fill in the blanks with what makes sense (Monkeys have tails -> George has a tail).

## 2. Eyewitness Testimony
This is terrifying for the Law.
Eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable.
If the police ask "How fast was the car when it *smashed* into the tree?", you remember broken glass.
If they ask "How fast was it when it *hit* the tree?", you don't.
The question changes the memory.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **False Memory** is a psychological phenomenon where a person recalls something that did not happen or recalls it differently from the way it actually happened. **The Mandela Effect** is a form of collective false memory. Research shows memory is reconstructive and highly suggestible, meaning our past is constantly being edited by our present.

## Introduction: Attention is a Spotlight
We think we see 100% of our visual field.
We don't. We only see what we attend to.
The rest is a blur that our brain fills in.
**Change Blindness** is the failure to notice large changes in the environment.

## 1. The Door Study
A stranger asks for directions.
While you are talking, two workers carry a door between you.
The stranger swaps places with one of the workers.
50% of people don't notice they are talking to a completely different person.
Why? Because you categorized them as "Stranger" (Generic NPC). You didn't memorize their face.

## 2. Magic
Magicians live on Change Blindness.
They wave the left hand (Misdirection) so you don't see the right hand pocketing the coin.
Your eyes are open, but your brain is closed.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Change Blindness** is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it. The famous **Invisible Gorilla** experiment demonstrates that intense focus on a task (counting basketball passes) renders us blind to unexpected events, even if they are glaringly obvious.

## Introduction: The Emotional Stamp
When a shocking event happens, the Amygdala (Emotion) stamps the Hippocampus (Memory).
"Save this forever."
These are **Flashbulb Memories**.
They feel vivid, detailed, and unchangeable.
Like a photograph.

## 1. The Confidence Trap
Scientists interviewed people the day after 9/11.
They interviewed them again 5 years later.
The memories had changed dramatically.
"I was watching TV" became "I was on the phone."
But the *Confidence* remained 100%.
Emotion does not guarantee Accuracy. It only guarantees Confidence.

## 2. Narrative
We turn our lives into stories.
We edit the Flashbulb Memory to fit the narrative of "Who I was then."
History is written by the victors; Memory is written by the Ego.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Flashbulb Memory** is a highly detailed, exceptionally vivid "snapshot" of the moment and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and consequential (or emotionally arousing) news was heard. While people feel extremely confident in these memories, studies show they degrade and distort over time just like regular memories.

## Introduction: Spatial Memory
Humans are bad at remembering numbers (7392).
We are good at remembering places (The route to your bathroom).
The **Method of Loci** exploits this.
You associate boring data with a vivid location.

## 1. How to do it
Want to buy: Milk, Eggs, Bread.
Imagine your front door.
There is a massive Cow blocking it (Milk).
You walk into the hall.
The floor is covered in cracked Eggs (Crunchy).
You go to the kitchen.
A baker is throwing loaves of Bread at you.
The weirder the image, the better.

## 2. World Champions
Memory Athletes use this to memorize 1,000 digits of Pi.
They build vast "Memory Palaces" (Castles, Childhood Homes) and fill them with data.
It proves that memory is a skill, not a talent.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Method of Loci** (Memory Palace) is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises. It involves visualization of spatial environments to enhance the recall of information. By placing items to be remembered at specific landmarks in a familiar mental journey, one can leverage the brain's powerful spatial navigation system.

## Introduction: The Blocking Hypothesis
The **Tip of the Tongue (TOT)** state.
It happens when you activate the *meaning* of the word, but the *sound* file is missing.
It's a disconnect between Semantics and Phonology.
Often, a similar word blocks the right one.
You want "Extinguish". You think "Extinct". Your brain gets stuck on "Extinct" and can't find the other path.

## 1. Universal
It happens in every language.
Deaf people have "Tip of the Finger" moments (Sign Language).
It gets worse as you age.
The more you struggle, the harder it is (Anxiety jams the signal).

## 2. The Pop-Up
You give up.
3 hours later, in the shower, the word pops into your head.
"Extinguish!"
Why? Because you stopped trying. The "Blocker" word faded, allowing the correct connection to fire.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Tip-of-the-Tongue** phenomenon (Presque Vu) is the failure to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent. It usually occurs when weak connections between the concept (meaning) and the lexical form (sound) prevent full activation.
