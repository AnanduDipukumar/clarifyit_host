## Introduction: Eubulides
Eubulides of Miletus asked:
Premise 1: 1 grain of sand is not a heap.
Premise 2: Adding 1 grain to something that is not a heap... does not make it a heap.
Conclusion: Therefore, 1 Million grains is not a heap. (Paradox).

## 1. Vagueness (Fuzzy Logic)
The problem isn't the sand. It's the word "Heap".
Most words have fuzzy boundaries.
"Tall", "Rich", "Bald".
If you lose one hair, you aren't bald.
So when do you become bald?
There is no hard line.
It is a gradient.
Computer Logic (Boolean: True/False) hates this.
Fuzzy Logic (0.0 to 1.0) handles it appropriately. (He is 0.7 Bald).

## 2. Species Problem
Biologists face this.
When did *Homo Erectus* become *Homo Sapiens*?
There was no single day where a non-human mom gave birth to a human baby.
It was a slow, imperceptible drift over 100,000 generations.
"Species" is a Sorites Paradox. We draw lines where nature sees gradients.

## 3. Abortion Debate
When does a fetus become a human?
Conception? 3 weeks? 20 weeks? Birth?
It is the Sorites Paradox applied to morality.
We force a binary law (Legal/Illegal) onto a biological process that is continuous.
This is why the debate never ends. Nature doesn't deal in binaries.

### Fact Box
*   **The Color Problem:** Where does Red become Orange? We can agree on "Pure Red" and "Pure Orange", but the boundary is subjective. Some cultures split them differently. Russian has two distinct primary words for Blue (Dark/Light).

## Introduction: The Trap
Atheists use this "Gotcha".
If God creates the stone -> He can't lift it -> He is not All-Powerful (Weakness).
If God can't create the stone -> He is not All-Powerful (Creativity Limit).
Either way, Omnipotence is logically impossible.

## 1. C.S. Lewis's Solution
Nonsense remains nonsense, even if you talk about God.
"Can God create a square circle?"
No. Because a square circle is a meaningless combination of words.
"Can God *bleeg-blag*?"
It's not a limit on God's power; it's a limit on logical definitions.
God can do anything *possible*. He cannot do the logically contradictory, because contradiction is not a "thing".

## 2. Descartes's Solution (Voluntarism)
Descartes said: **Yes**.
God *can* create a square circle.
God created math. He can break it.
Why don't we understand it?
Because our human brains are limited by the logic He installed in us.
God is above Logic.
(This is scary, because if God can do logical contradictions, He can be both Good and Evil).

## 3. The Simulator
If this is a simulation...
The Programmer (God) can easily create a rock (Object with Mass = Infinity).
Can he lift it?
He can just change the gravity variable to 0.
So yes, he can do both.
He can break the rules of the engine because he wrote them.

## Introduction: The Loop
Doctor Who explains it best.
A time traveler loves Beethoven. Goes back to 1770.
Finds nobody named Beethoven.
Panics.
Copies the symphonies from his iPod and publishes them under the name "Beethoven".
History is saved.
**But where did the music come from?**
Traveler got it from Beethoven. Beethoven got it from Traveler.
The information has no origin. It exists in a loop (Causal Loop).

## 1. Information from Nothing
This violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy).
You can't get something for nothing.
A symphony is high-order information.
In the loop, it was never "composed". It just appeared.

## 2. Terminator
Skynet sends a Terminator back to 1984.
Humans smash it. Find the chip.
They use the chip to invent Skynet.
Skynet was built from its own future wreckage.
**Predestination:** The past cannot be changed. The attempt to change it *causes* it.

## 3. Novikov Self-Consistency Principle
Physics solution.
Time travel is possible, but **Simples** are forbidden.
The universe will physically prevent you from killing your grandfather.
The gun will jam. You will slip.
The probability of "Success" is 0.
You are just an actor in a play that has already been written.
There is no Free Will in a closed timelike curve.

### Fact Box
*   **Interstellar:** Cooper gets the coordinates from "The Ghost". The Ghost is him. He sends the coordinates to himself so he can go to space to become the Ghost. It only works because he *already* did it.

## Introduction: Time Dilation
Special Connectivity says: The faster you move, the slower time passes for you.
Light Speed = Time Stop.

## 1. The Paradox
Twin A (Earth). Twin B (Rocket).
From A's perspective: B is moving. B should age slow.
From B's perspective: A is moving (Earth receding). A should age slow.
Motion is relative.
So when B returns... shouldn't they be the same age?
Why is B *actually* younger?

## 2. Measurements
The symmetry is broken.
Twin A sits still (Inertial Frame).
Twin B **Accelerates** (turns around).
To turn the spaceship around, B feels G-forces. A does not.
That acceleration snaps B into a "New Time Frame".
During the turn, B skips over years of Earth time.
The one who felt the G-force is the one who stays young.

## 3. Real Proof (Hafele-Keating)
1971. Scientists put atomic clocks on airplanes.
Flew them around the world.
Compared them to a clock on the ground.
The moving clocks were behind by nanoseconds.
GPS satellites fall out of sync by 38 microseconds a day. If we didn't correct for Einstein's math, your Google Maps would be off by 10km every day.

### Fact Box
*   **The Photon:** From the perspective of a Photon (Light particle), time does not exist. It is born in a star, travels 10 billion years, and hits your eye. To the photon, those two events happened *at the same instant*. Distance is 0. Time is 0.

## Introduction: The Clash
This paradox proves that linear single-timeline time travel is impossible.
Logic crashes.

## 1. Many Worlds Interpretation (Everett)
Solution: **Branching Timelines**.
When you arrive in 1920, you are not in *your* past.
You are in a Copy (Timeline B).
You kill Grandpa B.
You are never born in Timeline B.
But you (from Timeline A) still exist safely.
You can never go home to Timeline A.
You are stranded in a world where you don't exist.

## 2. Avengers: Endgame
"Back to the Future is bullshit." - Ant Man.
They explain Many Worlds.
Taking the Infinity Stone doesn't change *their* future. It creates a new "Doomed Timeline".
Captain America returns the stones to "Clip the branches".
(Physics note: Returning the stone doesn't actually clip the branch, but it's a nice movie plot).

## 3. Quantum Suicide
If Many Worlds is true... you are immortal.
If you play Russian Roulette.
In 5 universes, you die.
In 1 universe, the gun clicks.
Your consciousness *only continues* in the universe where you survive.
From your perspective, the gun *always* clicks.
You can never experience your own death.
(Do not test this. You will die in 99.9% of worlds and leave your family sad).

### Fact Box
*   **Stephen Hawking:** He held a party for Time Travelers. He sent the invitations *after* the party was over. Nobody came. Evidence that time travel is impossible (or Time Travelers are rude).
