## Introduction: The Tabula Rasa
John B. Watson (the father of Behaviorism) believed that humans are blank slates.
He wanted to prove he could program a child to fear anything.
He chose a 9-month-old baby known as "Albert B." (Little Albert).
Alburt was calm and happy. He loved animals.

## 1. The Clang
Watson showed Albert a white rat. Albert reached out to pet it.
Bang.
Watson struck a steel bar with a hammer behind Albert's head.
Albert cried.
They did this again. And again.
Rat -> Bang -> Cry.
Rat -> Bang -> Cry.

## 2. Generalization
Soon, they showed Albert the rat *without* the noise.
Albert cried and crawled away. He had learned to fear the rat.
But it didn't stop there.
He became terrified of:
*   A rabbit.
*   A dog.
*   A fur coat.
*   A Santa Claus mask.
His fear had "generalized" to anything fluffy and white.

## 3. The Unethical End
Watson never de-conditioned Albert.
The mother pulled him out of the study.
Albert (identified as Douglas Merritte) died at age 6 from hydrocephalus (water on the brain), unrelated to the study but tragic nonetheless.
The experiment proved Classical Conditioning works on humans, but it remains one of the most unethical studies in history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Little Albert Experiment** (1920) by John B. Watson demonstrated that emotional responses (like fear) could be classically conditioned in humans. By pairing a white rat with a loud noise, Watson taught a baby to fear the rat, a fear that subsequently generalized to other furry objects. The study is infamous for its ethical violations, as the child was never desensitized.

## Introduction: The Theory
Wendell Johnson (University of Iowa) had a theory: Stuttering isn't biological. It's learned.
He believed children stutter because their parents criticize their early mistakes.
to prove it, he needed to take normal children and criticize them until they broke.

## 1. The Experiment
He used 22 orphans.
Group A (The Control) was given praise. "You speak very well."
Group B (The Experiment) was tormented.
Every time they spoke, the researchers said: "Don't speak unless you can do it right." "You are becoming a stutterer." "Stop that."

## 2. The Result
The children in Group B did **not** develop a biological stutter.
However, they stopped talking.
They became withdrawn, anxious, and self-conscious.
They developed the *behavior* of stutterers (fear of speaking) without the speech defect.
The psychological damage was permanent.

## 3. The Secret
The study was conducted in 1939, right as news of Nazi human experimentation was reaching America.
Johnson was terrified he would be compared to them.
He buried the study (calling it the "Monster Study" in private).
It was only revealed in 2001. The University of Iowa issued a public apology.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Monster Study** (1939) was an unethical speech pathology experiment conducted by Wendell Johnson on 22 orphans. Attempting to prove that stuttering is induced by negative reinforcement, researchers systematically ridiculed the speech of flourishing children. While they failed to induce actual stuttering, they caused lifelong psychological trauma and speech anxiety in the subjects.

## Introduction: The Summer Camp
In 1954, Muzafer Sherif invited 22 boys to a summer camp in Oklahoma.
They didn't know they were part of an experiment.
He split them into two groups: **The Eagles** and **The Rattlers**.
For the first week, the groups didn't know the other existed. They bonded.

## 1. The Friction
Sherif introduced the groups via a tournament (Baseball, Tug-of-war).
The winners got trophies. The losers got nothing.
It escalated instantly.
Name-calling turned into food fights.
Then the Eagles burned the Rattlers' flag.
Then the Rattlers raided the Eagles' cabin and stole their jeans.
They were ready to fight with rocks.

## 2. The Solution
Sherif tried to stop the war by having them eat together. It failed (more food fights).
Then he created a **Superordinate Goal**.
He cut off the camp's water supply.
The boys from both teams *had* to work together to unblock the faucet.
Working on a shared problem destroyed the hatred.
By the end of the camp, they insisted on riding the same bus home.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Robbers Cave Experiment** (1954) demonstrated Realistic Conflict Theory. By separating boys into two groups and introducing competition for scarce resources, Muzafer Sherif successfully manufactured tribalism and hostility. He then proved that **Superordinate Goals** (goals that require cooperation to achieve) are the only effective way to reduce intergroup conflict.

## Introduction: The Cupboard Theory
In the 1950s, the dominant theory was that affection was a learned behavior derived from food.
"I love you because you feed me."
Harry Harlow disagreed. He believed in **Contact Comfort**.
To prove it, he separated baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers.

## 1. Wire vs Cloth
He gave them two surrogates:
1.  **Wire Mother:** Cold, hard mesh, but dispensed milk.
2.  **Cloth Mother:** Soft, warm terry cloth, but dispensed nothing.
The result was overwhelming.
The babies spent 22 hours a day clinging to the Cloth Mother.
They only went to the Wire Mother to eat, then immediately returned to the Cloth.

## 2. The Pit of Despair
Harlow then took it too far.
He isolated monkeys completely in a "Pit of Despair" for a year.
These monkeys were permanently psychologically damaged. Some stopped eating. Some stared at walls.
When reintroduced to others, they were terrified or aggressive.
It proved that **Social Touch** is a biological necessity, not a luxury.
It changed how we treat orphans and hospitalized children forever.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Harlow's Monkey Experiments** (1950s) disproved the theory that attachment is based solely on physiological needs (food). Baby rhesus monkeys overwhelmingly preferred a soft "Cloth Mother" (providing contact comfort) over a "Wire Mother" (providing food), demonstrating that emotional bonding and touch are crucial for normal psychological development.

## Introduction: The Accident
Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist (he won the Nobel Prize in 1904 for digestion).
He was measuring how much dogs salivated when fed.
He noticed something weird.
The dogs started drooling *before* the food appeared.
They drooled when they heard the footsteps of the assistant.
They had learned to predict the future.

## 1. The Experiment
Pavlov decided to formalize it.
1.  **Unconditioned Stimulus:** Food -> Drool (Natural).
2.  **Neutral Stimulus:** Bell -> No Drool (Nothing).
3.  **Conditioning:** Ring Bell + Give Food. Repeat 20 times.
4.  **Conditioned Stimulus:** Ring Bell -> Drool.
The brain physically rewired itself to connect the sound with the expectation of food.

## 2. Why It Matters
This isn't just about dogs.
Why do you feel hungry when you see the McDonald's logo?
Why do you check your phone when you hear a ding?
We are all Pavlov's dogs, reacting to the bells of modern marketing and technology.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ivan Pavlov** discovered **Classical Conditioning** accidentally while studying digestion. He demonstrated that a neutral stimulus (like a bell) could become a conditioned stimulus if paired repeatedly with a potent stimulus (food). This proved that learning is an associative process where the brain builds connections between unrelated events to predict the environment.
