## Introduction: The God Author
Traditionally, the Author is God.
If Shakespeare meant Hamlet to be mad, then Hamlet IS mad.
We study the author's biography to understand the text.
Roland Barthes (1967) said: **Stop it.**
Once the book is published, the Author is dead.

## 1. The Reader is Born
The meaning of a text is not in its origin, but in its destination.
**The Reader** creates the meaning.
If you read *Lord of the Rings* as an allegory for WWII, then it IS an allegory for WWII.
It doesn't matter that Tolkien explicitly said it wasn't.
Your interpretation is just as valid as the author's tweet.

## 2. Separation of Art and Artist
This theory is useful today.
"Can I enjoy H.P. Lovecraft if he was a racist?"
"Can I enjoy Harry Potter if I disagree with JK Rowling?"
**Death of the Author** says Yes.
The book belongs to you now. The racist ghost of Lovecraft has no power over it.
Steal the art. Ignore the artist.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Death of the Author** is a literary theory arguing that a writer's intentions and biography should not hold weight in interpreting their text. The meaning of a work is created by the **Reader** in the act of reading. It liberates the text from the tyranny of the "Correct Interpretation" dictated by the creator.

## Introduction: Not Fantasy
In **Fantasy** (Harry Potter), magic is a system. You wave a wand, you get a spell. People are amazed by it.
In **Magical Realism** (*One Hundred Years of Solitude*), magic is... boring.
It rains yellow flowers for a night.
A man lives to be 200.
The characters treat it like the weather. "Oh, it's raining flowers again."
It creates a dreamlike texture where the supernatural is woven into the gritty reality of life.

## 1. The Roots
It originated in Latin America.
Critics say it reflects the colonial reality.
When you live in a place where dictators change laws daily, religion is intense, and history is violent... reality *feels* unreal.
"The only difference between Surrealism and Latin America is that in Latin America, it is not art."

## 2. The Effect
It captures the **Subjective Truth** of life.
If you fall in love, you feel like you are flying.
Magical Realism just lets the character actually fly.
It makes the internal emotion external.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Magical Realism** is a literary genre where magical elements are a natural part of an otherwise mundane, realistic environment. Unlike fantasy, it does not invent a new world; it reveals the mystery of this one. It suggests that reality is too complex to be explained by physics alone.

## Introduction: Conservation of Detail
Anton Chekhov wrote:
"Remove everything that has no relevance to the story."
"If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall... then it absolutely must go off."
This is **Chekhov's Gun**.
It is a promise to the reader: "I am not wasting your time."

## 1. Foreshadowing vs Red Herrings
*   **Foreshadowing:** The Gun. It prepares you for the ending.
*   **Red Herring:** Showing the Gun, but the killer uses a Knife. This is a deliberate subversion to trick the audience.
*   **Bad Writing:** Showing the Gun, and then nothing happens. The audience feels cheated. "Why did we spend 5 pages describing the rifle?"

## 2. In Real Life
In movies, everything is a Gun. If the camera zooms in on a coffee cup, that cup is poisoned.
In Real Life, nothing is a Gun.
We see thousands of details (a weird stranger, a loud noise) that constitute "Noise". They mean nothing.
This is why Real Life makes for bad fiction. Fiction is life with the boring bits cut out.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Chekhov's Gun** is a dramatic principle stating that every element in a story must be necessary. If it is not necessary, remove it. It emphasizes the importance of **Foreshadowing** and efficient storytelling. A narrative should be a loaded gun, with no loose parts.

## Introduction: Newspeak
1984. Winston Smith lives in Airstrip One.
Yes, there are Telescreens (Surveillance).
But the true horror is **Newspeak**.
The Party is reducing the dictionary.
They remove words like "Freedom" and "Rebellion".
If you don't have a word for "Rebellion", you cannot think the thought.
"Orwellian" means **Controlling Thought by Controlling Language**.

## 1. Doublethink
**"War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength."**
This is **Doublethink**.
The ability to hold two contradictory beliefs in your mind and accept both.
It destroys objective truth.
If the Party says "2 + 2 = 5", then it equals 5.
Because "Truth" is whatever the Party says it is today.

## 2. Modern Parallels
When a government calls "Torture" -> "Enhanced Interrogation".
When a corporation calls "Firing people" -> "Right-sizing".
This is Orwellian.
It is sanitizing language to hide reality.
Orwell warned us: If we lose the words to describe the cage, we will never escape it.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Orwellian** describes a situation, idea, or societal condition that George Orwell identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. It typically refers to **Draconian Surveillance**, **Propaganda** (Newspeak), and **Doublethink**—the manipulation of truth to maintain total control.

## Introduction: The Trial
In *The Trial*, Josef K. is arrested.
He never finds out what the crime is.
He spends the whole book trying to navigate a bizarre, illogical court system.
The rules change constantly. The judges are invisible.
Eventually, he is executed "Like a dog."
This is **Kafkaesque**.

## 1. Meaningless Power
It represents the crushing weight of **Bureaucracy**.
It's not just "Scary".
It is scary because it is *Banal*.
The evil is not a monster. It is a clerk stamping a form.
The clerk doesn't hate you. He is just following a rule that makes no sense.
You are trapped in a machine that doesn't care if you live or die.

## 2. The Logic of the Absurd
In a Kafka story (*The Metamorphosis*), a man wakes up as a giant bug.
His family isn't horrified that he is a bug.
They are annoyed that he can't go to work and earn money.
The horror comes from the mundane reaction to the absurd.
It mirrors the feeling of fighting an insurance claim or a parking ticket. You are shouting at a wall.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Kafkaesque** describes a nightmarish complexity, characterized by senseless, disorienting, and menacing bureaucracy. Named after Franz Kafka, it evokes a world where the individual is powerless against a Faceless Authority that operates with a surreal, circular logic.
