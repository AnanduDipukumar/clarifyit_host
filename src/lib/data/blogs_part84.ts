## Introduction: The Eichmann Trial
1961. Adolf Eichmann (Architect of the Holocaust) was on trial in Jerusalem.
He said: "I was just following orders."
Was he a monster? Or a boring bureaucrat?
Stanley Milgram (Yale) wanted to test this.
He recruited 40 men for a "Memory Experiment".

## 1. The Setup
**Teacher:** The Volunteer.
**Learner:** An Actor (strapped to a chair in the next room).
**Experimenter:** Authority figure in a grey lab coat.
The Teacher gives a word test.
If the Learner fails, the Teacher initiates a shock.
15 Volts... 30 Volts... up to **450 Volts (XXX - Danger Severe Shock)**.
The Learner screams. He bangs on the wall. He begs for his heart condition. Then... silence.
If the Teacher hesitates, the Man in the Lab Coat says:
"Please continue."
"The experiment requires that you continue."
"You have no choice."

## 2. The Result (The Horror)
Psychologists predicted 0.1% (only Sadists) would go to 450 Volts.
**Actual Result:** 65% went to 450 Volts.
They were sweating. They were crying. They were begging to stop.
But they didn't stop.
They surrendered their agency to the Authority.
**Agency Theory:**
When you enter a hierarchy, you enter an "Agentic State". You view yourself as an instrument of another's will. You are no longer responsible.
"I am not killing him. The Scientist is killing him. I am just pushing the button."

## 3. Ethical Fallout
The participants were traumatized ("I realized I could be a Nazi").
This experiment created the **IRB (Institutional Review Board)** to stop unethical torture of volunteers.
But the lesson remains:
Evil is not typically done by psychopaths. It is done by normal people doing their jobs.

### Fact Box
*   **Replications:** It has been replicated in 2009 (Burger) and in Poland (2017). The numbers haven't changed. We are just as obedient today as we were in 1961.

## Introduction: The Coin Flip
1971. Stanford University.
24 healthy, normal students.
Coin flip: "Guard" or "Prisoner".
Guards got sunglasses, batons, and uniforms.
Prisoners got smocks, chains, and ID numbers.
Zimbardo said: "Maintain order."

## 1. The Descent
**Day 1:** Giggle. Playing a game.
**Day 2:** Rebellion. Prisoners barricaded the door.
**Day 2 Night:** The Guards retaliated. They stripped the prisoners naked. They put bags over their heads. They made them do pushups.
**Day 3:** Breakdowns. Prisoner #8612 started screaming incoherently. He had to be released.
**Day 5:** Sexual humiliation.
Zimbardo (The Warden) got lost in the role too. He forgot he was a scientist.

## 2. Christina Maslach
Christina (Zimbardo's girlfriend) visited the "Prison".
She saw the guards marching prisoners to the toilet with bags on their heads.
She said: "This is terrible. You have to stop this."
Zimbardo snapped out of it.
He ended the experiment on Day 6 (intended for 2 weeks).
**Conclusion:**
 Situations matter more than Personality.
Give a normal person unchecked power (Uniform + Anonymity), and they will abuse it.
(See: Abu Ghraib prison scandal).

## 3. The Criticism (Fraud?)
Recent leaks (2018) suggest Zimbardo *told* the guards to be tough ("Be like Cool Hand Luke guards").
Some prisoners admitted they "faked" the breakdown to get out early.
It might have been theatre, not science.
But the psychological impact (Deindividuation) is a real phenomenon confirmed by history.

### Fact Box
*   **The Number:** The prisoners were referred to *only* by number. Within days, they stopped using their names. They introduced themselves as "I am 819". Dehumanization is the first step to atrocity.

## Introduction: The Murder
1964. Queens, NY.
Kitty Genovese was attacked. She screamed "Help me!"
Lights turned on in the apartment building. People looked out.
The attacker ran away.
Nobody came down.
He came back. He stabbed her again.
It took 30 minutes. 38 witnesses. Zero calls to police (until too late).
The Times called it "Apathy".
Psychologists called it **Diffusion of Responsibility**.

## 1. The Math of Crowds
If you are the only witness, you have 100% responsibility. You help.
If there are 10 witnesses, you have 10% responsibility.
You think: "Someone else probably called already."
Everyone thinks that.
So nobody calls.
**Smoke Filled Room Study (Latane & Darley):**
You sit in a room. Smoke pours in under the door.
If alone: You report it in 2 minutes.
If with 3 passive actors (who ignore the smoke): You sit there for 20 minutes while the room fills with smoke. You don't want to look weird.

## 2. Evaluation Apprehension
We fear looking stupid more than we fear danger.
"What if it's not a murder? What if it's just a lovers' quarrel? If I intervene, I'll be embarrassed."
We look at others to gauge the social norm.
Since everyone else is looking at everyone else (doing nothing), the "Group Norm" becomes "Do Nothing".
**Pluralistic Ignorance.**

## 3. How to Hack It
If you have a heart attack in a crowd:
Don't yell "Help!" (Too vague. Diffusion applies).
Point at one specific person.
"You! In the Red Jacket! Call 911!"
You break the diffusion. You give him 100% responsibility. He will act instantly.

### Fact Box
*   **Good Samaritan Laws:** Legally, in the US, you have no duty to rescue (unless you caused the danger). Wait... actually, many states passed laws *protecting* you if you try to help (e.g., break a rib doing CPR) to encourage intervention.

## Introduction: The WWII Morphine
Henry Beecher (Army Doctor) ran out of morphine at Anzio.
Soldiers were screaming.
He injected them with Saline (Salt water) but *told* them it was Morphine.
The soldiers stopped screaming. They didn't go into shock.
The pain actually went away.
The brain released **Endogenous Opioids** (Endorphins) because it *expected* relief.

## 1. It operates on belief
Big Red pills work better than Small White pills.
Injections work better than pills.
Expensive pills work better than cheap pills.
Surgery works best of all.
**Fake Knee Surgery:**
Doctors cut the knee open, did nothing, and sewed it up.
The patients reported just as much pain relief as the real surgery.
The ritual of the hospital triggers the healing mechanism.

## 2. Nocebo (The Evil Twin)
If you believe something will hurt, it will hurt.
**The Refrigerator Truck:**
A sailor got locked in a freezer. He shivered. He wrote a note: "Freezing to death."
He died.
When they opened it... the freezer was **Broken**.
It was 19°C (Room temp) inside.
He died of Hypothermia purely because he believed he was cold.
**Voodoo Death:**
If a Shaman points a bone at you and says "You will die," your sympathetic nervous system goes into overdrive (Fight or Flight) until your heart stops. Fear kills.

## 3. Ethics
If Placebos work... should doctors lie?
"Here is a magic pill."
The American Medical Association says No. It breaks trust.
**Open Label Placebo:**
Doctors say: "This is a sugar pill. But it helps many people because of the mind-body connection."
Surprisingly, it *still works*. You don't even need to be tricked. You just need to take the ritual seriously.

### Fact Box
*   **The Drug Trial:** To approve a new drug, it must beat the Placebo. Many antidepressants fail this. The Placebo cures 40%, the Drug cures 45%. Is the side effect risk worth the 5% gain?
