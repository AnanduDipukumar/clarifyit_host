## Introduction: The Invasion
After WWI, veterans were given land in Western Australia to grow wheat.
A drought hit. Then the Emus arrived.
20,000 giant flightless birds migrated to the coast, destroying fences and crops.
The farmers asked the government for help.
The Minister of Defense sent Major Meredith and two soldiers with Lewis Machine Guns.

## 1. The Tactics
They thought it would be easy. Ideally, the birds would huddle together.
But Emus are smart. They split into small guerrilla groups.
They ran at 30mph.
The soldiers fired thousands of rounds. They hit... maybe 12 birds.
The gun jammed. The birds laughed (probably).

## 2. The Surrender
The Army retreated.
The government later put a bounty on Emu beaks, which worked better.
But officially, the Royal Australian Artillery lost a war to birds.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Great Emu War** (1932) was a military operation in Australia to curb the emu population destroying crops. Soldiers armed with Lewis machine guns failed to significantly reduce the numbers of the fast-moving birds, leading to a humiliating withdrawal and the realization that nature is harder to fight than humans.

## Introduction: San Juan Island
The border between the US and Canada (British) wasn't clear on San Juan Island.
Both Americans and British lived there peacefully.
Until an American farmer (Lyman Cutlar) found a British pig eating his potatoes.
He shot the pig.
The British owner demanded justice. The American refused.

## 1. Escalation
The Americans called in the Army (Captain George Pickett).
The British sent 3 warships.
Within weeks, 500 Americans with cannons were staring at 2,000 British sailors.
Orders were given: "Fire if they land."

## 2. The Resolution
The British Admiral, Robert Baynes, arrived.
He said, "I refuse to involve two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig."
They laughed it off. The only casualty was the pig.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Pig War** (1859) was a border confrontation between the US and Great Britain over the San Juan Islands. Triggered by the shooting of a pig, it escalated into a military standoff. Diplomacy prevailed, and it serves as a rare example of a potential war diffused by common sense.

## Introduction: World Cup Qualifiers
1969. Tensions were high due to immigration issues.
El Salvador played Honduras in a World Cup qualifier.
Fans fought in the stands. Riots started.
Hondurans burned Salvadoran flags.
Salvadoran pilots dropped bombs on Honduras.

## 1. The 100 Hour War
The Salvadoran Army invaded.
It wasn't really about soccer (it was about land density), but the match lit the fuse.
6,000 people died.
The OAS negotiated a ceasefire after 4 days.

## 2. The Result
El Salvador actually won the match and went to the World Cup.
But the war destroyed the Central American Common Market for decades.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Football War** (1969) between El Salvador and Honduras was sparked by riots during a 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier, though the underlying causes were immigration and land reform. The 4-day conflict resulted in thousands of casualties and long-lasting economic damage to the region.

## Introduction: Guelfs and Ghibellines
1325. Modena vs Bologna.
They hated each other for religious reasons (Pope vs Emperor).
Soldiers from Modena sneaked into Bologna and stole an oak bucket filled with loot from a well.
Bologna demanded it back. Modena refused.

## 1. Battle of Zappolino
Bologna sent 32,000 men. Modena had 7,000.
Shockingly, Modena won.
They chased the Bolognese back to their city walls.
As a final insult, they took a *second* bucket.

## 2. The Trophy
The bucket is still on display in the bell tower of Modena.
It is a reminder that people will die for pride, symbols, and literal garbage.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **War of the Bucket** (1325) was fought between the Italian city-states of Modena and Bologna. While often trivialized as a fight over a stolen bucket (which Modena kept as a trophy), it was actually part of the 300-year struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines.

## Introduction: The Ultimatum
August 27, 1896.
A new Sultan took over Zanzibar without British permission.
The British had warships in the harbor.
They sent a message: "Step down by 9:00 AM, or we fire."
The Sultan refused.

## 1. 9:02 AM
At 9:02, the British ships opened fire.
They destroyed the palace. They sank the Sultan's yacht.
They killed or wounded 500 defenders.
The Sultan surrendered at 9:40 AM.

## 2. Efficiency
The British suffered one casualty (a sailor stubbed his toe? - minor injury).
It shows the terrifying gap between industrial military power and traditional resistance.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Anglo-Zanzibar War** (1896) holds the record for the shortest war in history, lasting between 38 and 45 minutes. The British Royal Navy bombarded the Sultan's palace to enforce a treaty, quickly crushing resistance and installing a pro-British puppet government.
