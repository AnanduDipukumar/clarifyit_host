## Introduction: The Pressure
At sea level: 1 atmosphere (14 psi).
At the bottom: 1000 atmospheres (8 tons per inch).
It crushes steel submarines like soda cans.
Only 3 expeditions have touched bottom.
1.  **Trieste (1960):** Walsh and Piccard. Window cracked. They stayed 20 mins.
2.  **James Cameron (2012):** Built his own sub (Deepsea Challenger). Stayed 3 hours.
3.  **Victor Vescovo (2019):** Found a plastic bag.

## 1. Life?
Yes.
Amphipods (Giant shrimp).
Snailfish (Translucent, no scales).
They have special proteins to stop their cells from collapsing.
Xenophyophores (Single-celled amoebas the size of a grapefruit).

## 2. Geology
It is a Subduction Zone.
 The Pacific Plate is sliding *under* the Mariana Plate.
It drags mountains down into the mantle.
It is the "Recycling Center" of the Earth's crust.
The friction causes earthquakes and volcanoes.

## 3. The Sound
It is not silent.
It is noisy.
Whale calls from miles away funnel down the trench.
Earthquakes rumble.
James Cameron said it was the most desolate place on Earth. "Lunar."

### Fact Box
*   **Plastic:** Vescovo found a plastic candy wrapper at the bottom. 10,928 meters deep. We have polluted places we haven't even explored yet.

## Introduction: SOSUS
During the Cold War, the US put microphones (Hydrophones) all over the ocean to track Soviet Subs.
In 1997, they picked up a signal.
Coordinates: 50°S 100°W (Remote South Pacific).
Profile: Low frequency, rising pitch. "Bloop".
Duration: 1 minute.
Volume: Detonated across 5,000 km range.

## 1. The Animal Theory
Blue Whale calls travel 1000 miles.
But this was much louder.
If it was an animal, it would have to be 3x bigger than a Blue Whale.
A Kraken? Cthulhu? (Lovecraft set Cthulhu's city R'lyeh very close to these coordinates).

## 2. The Icequake Theory
2005. NOAA solved it.
It matches the profile of an **Icequake**.
A massive iceberg cracking and calving off Antarctica.
Ice groaning.
When a mountain of ice splits, it screams.
Not a monster. Just physics.

## 3. Other Sounds
*   **Julia:** Sounds like a woman cooing. (Iceberg rubbing sea floor).
*   **Upsweep:** A seasonal sound. (Volcanic activity?).
The ocean is full of ghosts.

### Fact Box
*   **52 Hertz Whale:** The loneliest whale. He sings at 52Hz. Other Blue Whales sing at 15-20Hz. They can't hear him. Or they ignore him. He has been swimming alone for decades, calling out to no one.

        description: "Sailors told stories of 100ft waves that appeared from nowhere. Science said they were lying. Then we measured one.",

## Introduction: The Linear Model
Physics said: Ocean waves are Gaussian.
A 30-meter wave is statistically impossible (Once in 10,000 years).
If a captain reported one, he was "drunk".

## 1. The Draupner Wave (1995)
New Year's Day. North Sea.
An oil platform (Draupner) had a laser sensor.
Sea state: 12 meters (Rough).
Suddenly... a single wave hit.
Height: **25.6 meters (84 feet)**.
It was a vertical wall.
The graph went vertical.
Science admitted: "They are real."

## 2. Constructive Interference
How?
Waves travel at different speeds.
Sometimes, a fast wave catches a slow wave.
And a current pushes against them.
They stack up.
1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
For typical waves, this creates a "Super Wave".
It lasts only a few minutes, then collapses.
But if it hits a ship... it breaks it in half.

## 3. Disappearances
Hundreds of large ships (Tankers, Container ships) have disappeared without a trace in the last 50 years.
"Lost with all hands."
We used to blame the Bermuda Triangle.
Now we blame Rogue Waves.
The ship falls into the "Hole" before the wave, then 1000 tons of water crash onto the deck. Instant sinking.

### Fact Box
*   **Benjamin Franklin:** He noticed that pouring oil on water calmed the waves. It forms a monolayer that stops the wind from grabbing the water surface (capillary waves). Ancient sailors carried oil for storms.

## Introduction: Photosynthesis
We thought all life depended on the Sun.
Sun -> Plants -> Herbivores -> Carnivores.
The deep ocean should be dead (No sun).

## 1. Chemosynthesis
1977. Alvin submersible. Galapagos Rift.
They found "Black Smokers". Chimneys spewing black mineral water at 400°C.
And they found **Life**.
Giant Tube Worms (Riftia). 2 meters long. Red feathers.
They have no mouth. No gut. no anus.
Inside them live bacteria.
The bacteria eat **Hydrogen Sulfide** (Rotten egg gas) from the vent.
They turn chemical energy into sugar.
**Chemosynthesis.**

## 2. Origin of Life
Biologists flipped.
Maybe life didn't start in a "Warm Little Pond" on the surface (Darwin).
Maybe it started *here*.
The vents provide heat, energy, minerals. Protected from meteorite strikes (which were common on early Earth).
"LUCA" (Last Universal Common Ancestor) was likely a heat-loving vent bacteria.

## 3. Europa and Enceladus
This means life could be on Jupiter's moon (Europa).
It has an ice crust. But a liquid ocean underneath.
And gravity tides create heat. Vents?
If vents exist on Europa... whales could differ there.
We don't need a "Goldilocks Zone" (Sun distance). We just need water and heat.

### Fact Box
*   **The Yeti Crab:** A crab that grows fur (bacteria) on its arms. It waves its arms in the vent water to feed the bacteria, then eats the bacteria. It's a farmer.

## Introduction: The Gyre
The Pacific currents swirl in a circle (North Pacific Gyre).
Anything thrown in... gets trapped in the center.
It is a vortex of trash.

## 1. The Soup
Misconception: "An island of trash."
Reality: "Confetti Soup."
Sunlight breaks plastic down into **Microplastics**.
The water looks cloudy.
Fish eat the plastic. We eat the fish.
We are eating credit cards. (Average human eats 5g of plastic a week).

## 2. Ghost Nets
46% of the mass is discarded fishing nets.
"Ghost Nets" float forever, killing whales, turtles, and seals.
They tangle propellers.
It is industrial waste, not just plastic straws.

## 3. The Cleanup (Boyan Slat)
A 20-year-old kid invented "The Ocean Cleanup".
A giant U-shaped floating barrier.
It uses the wind/current to catch the plastic.
Like a Pac-Man.
It is working. They are hauling tons of plastic out.
But we dump 8 million tons *in* every year.
We need to turn off the tap.

### Fact Box
*   **The Rubber Ducks:** In 1992, a shipping container fell off a boat. 28,000 rubber ducks escaped. Oceanographers tracked them for 20 years to map global currents. Some made it to Europe. Some are still floating.
