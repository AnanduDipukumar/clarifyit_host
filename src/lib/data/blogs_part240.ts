## Introduction: The Ring World
Saturn is beautiful but deadly.
The **Cassini** probe arrived in 2004.
It dropped a lander (**Huygens**) onto the moon Titan.
It sent back the first photo from the surface of an alien moon (liquid methane rivers).

## 1. Enceladus
Cassini flew through the plumes of the ice moon Enceladus.
It tasted salt water.
It proved there is a warm ocean under the ice.
Life might be swimming there right now.

## 2. The Death Dive
In 2017, Cassini ran out of fuel.
NASA couldn't risk it crashing into Enceladus (contaminating the pristine ocean with Earth bacteria).
So they ordered the "Grand Finale".
Cassini dove *between* the rings and the planet (a gap no one had ever flown).
Then it burned up in Saturn's atmosphere, sending data until the very last second.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Cassini–Huygens** was a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and ASI to study the Saturnian system. It revolutionized our understanding of the rings and moons, specifically discovering the hydrocarbon lakes of **Titan** and the subsurface ocean of **Enceladus**. Its intentional destruction in 2017 was a Planetary Protection measure.

## Introduction: The Boom
"Hey Houston, we've had a problem here."
Jack Swigert stirred the oxygen tanks. Tank 2 blew up.
They lost power, water, and air.
The Command Module was dead.
They had to move into the Lunar Module (The Lander).
It was designed for 2 men for 2 days. It had to hold 3 men for 4 days.

## 1. The Square Peg
They were breathing too much CO2.
They had scrubbers (filters), but the Command Module had square filters. The Lunar Module took round ones.
Engineers on Earth had to figure out how to fit a square peg in a round hole using only trash found on the ship (Duct tape, socks, flight manuals).
They radioed the instructions. It worked.

## 2. The Re-entry
They survived the cold. They manually aligned the ship using the Earth in the window (no computer).
They splashed down safely.
It was NASA's "Successful Failure".

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Apollo 13** was the seventh crewed mission in the Apollo space program and the third meant to land on the Moon. The landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded. The mission is celebrated for the improvised engineering solutions by the crew and ground control that allowed the astronauts to return safely despite critical system failures.

## Introduction: Are We Alone?
In the 90s, we didn't know if other stars had planets.
Maybe our solar system was a freak accident.
**Kepler** launched in 2009 to find out.

## 1. The Transit Method
It didn't take photos of planets (they are too small/dark).
It measured the brightness of stars.
If a planet passes in front of a star, the light dips by 0.01%.
Kepler stared at 150,000 stars simultaneously, looking for that wink.

## 2. The Result
It found 2,600+ planets.
Hot Jupiters. Super Earths. Lava Worlds.
It proved that **Planets are common**.
On average, every star has at least one planet.
That means there are billions of Earths in our galaxy alone.
The odds of alien life just went up.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Kepler Space Telescope** was a NASA observatory designed to discover Earth-size planets orbiting other stars. By using the **Transit Photometry** method (detecting periodic dimming of a star), it revolutionized exoplanet science, showing that small, rocky worlds are abundant in the Milky Way.

## Introduction: The Dirty Snowball
Comets are leftovers from the birth of the solar system.
ESA launched **Rosetta** in 2004 to catch Comet 67P.
It had to loop around Earth and Mars 4 times to build up speed (Slingshots).

## 1. The Landing (Philae)
2014. Rosetta arrived.
It dropped the lander **Philae**.
Harpoons were supposed to fire to anchor it to the ice.
They failed.
Philae bounced. Twice.
It flew 1km off the surface and landed in a dark crack.

## 2. The Nap
Ideally, it would land in the sun (Solar panels).
In the dark, its battery died after 60 hours.
But in those 60 hours, it sniffed the comet.
It found Organic Molecules (The building blocks of life).
It suggests comets might have brought life to Earth.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Rosetta** mission was the first to rendezvous with a comet (67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko) and deploy a lander (**Philae**). Despite the lander's harpoons failing, leading to a bounce into a shadowed crevice, the mission provided unprecedented data on cometary composition, including the discovery of amino acid precursors.

## Introduction: Heavy Metal
Previous rovers (Spirit/Opportunity) were small. We landed them in giant airbags. They bounced.
**Curiosity** was the size of a car (900kg). Airbags would explode.
Parachutes don't consider the thin atmosphere (Mars air is 1% of Earth).
Rockets would kick up too much dust and damage the instruments.

## 1. The Crazy Plan
Engineers invented the **Sky Crane**.
1. Parachute slows it down.
2. Backshell drops away.
3. A \"Jetpack\" hovers 20 meters above the ground.
4. It lowers the Rover on cables.
5. Rover touches wheels down.
6. Cables cut. Jetpack flies away and crashes.

## 2. Gale Crater
It worked perfectly.
Curiosity found ancient riverbeds.
It drilled rocks and found carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur.
The ingredients for life.
Mars was once habitable.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Curiosity** is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Gale Crater as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission. Its landing involved a never-before-used **Sky Crane** maneuver. Since 2012, it has been analyzing the Martian climate and geology, providing definitive evidence that Mars once offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.
