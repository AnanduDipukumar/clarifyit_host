## Introduction: The Longship
The Viking secret weapon wasn't the axe. It was the **Longship**.
It could cross oceans *and* sail up shallow rivers.
They could strike anywhere. Paris. London. Seville.
They were fast and amphibious. The Navy Seals of the Dark Ages.

## 1. Trade
We see them as bloodthirsty berserkers (Lindisfarne).
But they were mostly businessmen.
They connected Constantinople to Dublin.
They sold furs, amber, and slaves.
They founded Kiev (The Kievan Rus) which became Russia.
They settled in France (Normandy) and became the Normans (who conquered England).
They remade the map of Europe.

## 2. Vinland
Leif Erikson sailed West from Greenland.
He found Canada (Newfoundland) around 1000 AD.
They called it **Vinland** (Wine Land).
They fought the locals (Skraelings) and left.
If they had stayed, history would be vastly different.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Vikings** were Norse seafarers, mainly speaking the Old Norse language, who raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of northern, central, eastern, and western Europe, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries. They were skilled navigators who reached North America, North Africa, and the Middle East.

## Introduction: Bread, Land, and Peace
World War I destroyed Russia.
Millions died. The people were starving.
Czar Nicholas II was incompetent.
The people revolted (February Revolution) and the Czar abdicated.
But the new government kept fighting the war.
Mistake.

## 1. The Bolsheviks
Vladimir Lenin arrived on a train (sent by Germany to destabilize Russia).
His slogan: "Bread, Land, and Peace."
It worked.
The Bolsheviks seized power in October.
They killed the Czar and his family.
Civil War followed (Reds vs Whites).

## 2. The Legacy
The Soviet Union (USSR) was born.
It promised Utopia. It delivered the Gulag.
But it also transformed Russia from a backward feudal state into a nuclear superpower in 40 years.
It set the stage for the Cold War.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Russian Revolution** was a period of political and social revolution across the territory of the Russian Empire, commencing with the abolition of the monarchy in 1917 and concluding in 1923 with the Bolshevik establishment of the **Soviet Union**. It was led by **Vladimir Lenin** and the Bolshevik Party, marking the first successful communist revolution in history.

## Introduction: 1492
In one year:
1.  They kicked the Moors out of Granada (Reconquista).
2.  They expelled the Jews.
3.  Columbus found America.
Spain hit the jackpot.

## 1. Potosi
They found a mountain of silver in Bolivia (Potosi).
They enslaved the locals to mine it.
Spanish Galleons shipped tons of silver to China (to buy silk) and Europe (to pay for wars).
The definition of a global currency was the "Piece of Eight".

## 2. The Resource Curse
Money is not Wealth.
Spain had so much silver that they got **Hyperinflation**.
They didn't build factories. They just bought stuff.
When the silver ran out, they had no industry.
England and the Dutch (who had to work for a living) overtook them.
It is the classic story of the lottery winner who goes broke.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Spanish Empire** was one of the largest empires in history. From the late 15th to the early 19th centuries, Spain controlled a huge overseas territory in the New World and the Philippines. Its wealth was built on the extraction of **Silver** from the Americas, which fueled the first global trade network but also led to rampant inflation and economic stagnation at home.

## Introduction: The Eagle and the Snake
They built their capital on a lake (Mexico City).
It was an engineering marvel.
Clean streets. Zoos. Botanical gardens.
But they were hated by their neighbors.
Why? The Flower Wars.

## 1. The Sacrifice
The Aztecs believed the Sun God (Huitzilopochtli) needed human blood to fight the darkness.
They didn't conquer neighbors for land. They conquered them to get captives for sacrifice.
Thousands were killed on the pyramids annually.

## 2. Cortez
When Hernan Cortez arrived with 500 men, he couldn't defeat the Aztecs alone.
But 100,000 native allies (Tlaxcalans) joined him.
They hated the Aztecs.
Then Smallpox struck.
The empire fell in 1521.
It was a clash of civilizations where disease held the casting vote.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Aztec Empire** (Triple Alliance) dominated central Mexico from 1428 until 1521. They built the magnificent capital **Tenochtitlan** on Lake Texcoco. Known for their complex calendar, agriculture (Chinampas), and ritual **Human Sacrifice**, they were conquered by the Spanish Conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés, aided by indigenous uprisings and smallpox.

## Introduction: The Manchus
The Qing weren't Han Chinese. They were Manchus (Invaders from the North).
They forced Chinese men to wear the **Queue** (braid) as a sign of submission.
Under Emperors Kangxi and Qianlong, China was the richest, most powerful nation on Earth.
They thought they were the center of the world (The Middle Kingdom).

## 1. The Stagnation
They ignored Western technology.
Lord Macartney visited in 1793 to trade. The Emperor dismissed him: "We have everything we need."
Bad move.
The Industrial Revolution was happening in Europe. China stood still.

## 2. The Century of Humiliation
The British wanted Tea. China wanted Silver.
Britain ran out of Silver. So they started selling **Opium**.
China tried to ban it.
Britain sent gunboats (The Opium Wars).
The Chinese junks were destroyed by steamships.
The Empire collapsed in 1912, ending 2,000 years of Imperial rule.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Qing Dynasty** (1644–1912) was the last imperial dynasty of China. Established by the Manchus, it marked the zenith of Chinese territorial expansion and culture but declined due to internal corruption, population pressure, and military defeats by Western powers (Opium Wars). Its fall marked the beginning of modern Republican China.
