## Introduction: The Rotation Problem
Imagine a merry-go-round.
The horses near the center move slowly.
The horses near the edge move fast.
Gravity works the opposite way.
Mercury (Center) orbits the Sun at 47 km/s.
Neptune (Edge) orbits at 5 km/s.
If Neptune went 47 km/s, it would fly off into deep space. Gravity fades with distance ($1/r^2$).
**Vera Rubin** (1970s) looked at Galaxy Andromeda.
She measured the speed of stars at the edge.
**Shock:** They were moving just as fast as the stars in the center (250 km/s).
By all laws of Newton and Einstein, the galaxy should rip itself apart.
There was not enough visible mass (Stars/Gas) to hold it together.
She concluded: "There must be an invisible halo of matter holding it together."
She called it **Dark Matter**.

## 1. What is it? (The Candidates)
We know what it is *not*.
It is not protons/neutrons (Baryonic matter). If it were dust, it would block light.
It is not Black Holes (we would see the lensing).
**WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles):**
The leading theory. A ghost particle that has mass but does not interact with electromagnetism (light) or the strong force.
It passes through the Earth continuously.
We built massive tanks of Liquid Xenon (LZ Experiment) deep underground to catch one.
Result: Zero. We haven't found it.

## 2. The Bullet Cluster
Some skeptics (MOND - Modified Newtonian Dynamics) said: "Maybe gravity works differently at large scales?"
Then we saw the **Bullet Cluster**.
Two galaxies collided.
The Gas (visible matter) smashed together and stopped in the middle (collision).
The Dark Matter (inferred by gravitational lensing) passed right through the collision without stopping.
It proved that Dark Matter is distinct from Normal Matter. It is a real substance, not just a math error.

## 3. The Cosmic Web
Supercomputers simulate the universe.
If you simulate *only* normal matter, galaxies never form. The gas is too hot.
You need Dark Matter to act as the "Skeleton".
It clumps together first. Its gravity pulls the gas in.
Stars form inside the Dark Matter pockets.
Every galaxy is just a tiny glowing decoration on a massive invisible Christmas tree structure.
Without Dark Matter, we would not exist.

### Fact Box
*   **Dark Energy:** Don't confuse them. Dark Matter *pulls* things together (Gravity). Dark Energy *pushes* the universe apart (Anti-Gravity). They are opposites. Together, they make up 95% of everything. We are the 5% rounding error.

## Introduction: The Collapse
A massive star dies. It explodes (Supernova).
The core collapses.
Gravity is so strong it crushes electrons *into* protons.
$p^+ + e^- \rightarrow n^0 + \nu$ (Neutron + Neutrino).
The entire star becomes a nucleus of Neutrons.
It is the densest material in the universe (short of a singularity).
**Density:** Imagine crushing a Boeing 747 into a grain of sand.

## 1. The Structure (Nuclear Pasta)
**The Crust:** Iron lattice. Incredibly hard.
**The Mantle:** Superfluid neutrons.
**The Inner Core:** Quark-Gluon Plasma? Strange Matter? We don't know.
**Nuclear Pasta:**
Deep inside, the pressure squeezes nuclei into weird shapes.
*   **Gnocchi Phase:** Blobs.
*   **Spaghetti Phase:** Rods.
*   **Lasagna Phase:** Sheets.
It is the strongest material in the universe. 10 billion times stronger than steel.

## 2. Pulsars (The Lighthouse)
Conservation of Angular Momentum.
Ice skater pulls arms in -> Spins faster.
The star shrinks from 1,000,000 km to 20 km.
It spins at **700 times per second**.
It has a magnetic field.
It shoots beams of radiation from its poles.
As it spins, the beam sweeps across Earth.
*Blip-Blip-Blip.*
Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered them in 1967. She called it **LGM-1** (Little Green Men) because the signal was so perfect she thought it was aliens.

## 3. Magnetars (The Monster)
Some neutron stars have magnetic fields $10^{15}$ Gauss.
(Your fridge magnet is 100 Gauss. MRI is 30,000 Gauss).
If a Magnetar flew past the Moon (240,000 miles away), it would wipe every credit card on Earth.
**Starquakes:**
The crust cracks.
It releases a flare of Gamma Rays.
In 2004, a flare from SGR 1806-20 (50,000 light years away) hit Earth.
It physically condensed the ionosphere. It blinded satellites.
If it had been within 10 light years, it would have destroyed the Ozone Layer and caused mass extinction.

### Fact Box
*   **Kilonova:** When two neutron stars collide, they explode purely in neutrons. This creates Gold. A single collision creates 10 Earths worth of Gold and Platinum. Your wedding ring was forged in a neutron star crash.

## Introduction: Frozen Stars
Einstein didn't believe in them.
Karl Schwarzschild solved Einstein's equations in the trenches of WWI (1916).
He found a singularity.
If you squeeze mass $M$ into radius $R_s = 2GM/c^2$, gravity becomes infinite.
For the Earth to become a black hole, you'd have to squeeze it into the size of a peanut.

## 1. Spaghettification (Tidal Forces)
You fall feet first.
Gravity gets stronger closer to the center ($1/r^2$).
The pull on your feet is millions of Gs stronger than the pull on your head.
You are stretched.
You resemble a long strand of spaghetti.
Then you snap.
This happens *before* you even hit the event horizon (for small holes).
For Supermassive Black Holes (Gargantua), tidal forces are weak at the horizon. You could survive crossing it, only to die later at the singularity.

## 2. Time Dilation (Interstellar)
Gravity bends Time.
If you stand near the horizon, time slows down relative to outside.
**The Frozen Star:**
To a distant observer, you never fall in.
You slow down. You turn red (Redshift). You freeze at the edge forever.
To *you*, you fall in instantly.
There is a fundamental disagreement about reality between the two observers. This is Relativity.

## 3. Hawking Radiation (Evaporation)
Stephen Hawking proved they aren't truly black.
Quantum fluctuations at the edge create particle pairs.
One falls in (Negative Energy). One escapes (Positive Energy).
The hole loses mass.
Eventually, it evaporates and explodes.
It takes $10^{67}$ years.
This solves the entropy paradox but creates the **Information Paradox**. (Did the information of what fell in get destroyed? Quantum mechanics says information is indestructible. War ensues among physicists).

### Fact Box
*   **The Shadow:** We took a picture of M87 in 2019 (Event Horizon Telescope). We didn't see the hole (invisible). We saw the glowing donut of gas (Accretion Disc) swirling around it. It proved Einstein right... again.

## Introduction: The Vela Mystery
In the 1960s, the US launched Vela satellites to spy on Soviet nuclear tests.
They detected massive blasts of Gamma Rays.
But they weren't coming from Russia. Or Earth.
They were coming from Deep Space.
**What are they?**
Hypernova. When a super-massive star collapses into a Black Hole.
It shoots two jets of plasma at 99.99% speed of light.
If the jet is pointed at you, you see a **Gamma Ray Burst (GRB)**.
Energy output: In 10 seconds, it releases more energy than the Sun will emit in its entire 10-billion-year life.

## 1. The Death Zone
If a GRB hit Earth from 6,000 light years away:
1.  **The Flash:** The side of Earth facing the beam would be fried by UV radiation.
2.  **Ozone Death:** The Gamma rays would rip apart Nitrogen/Oxygen molecules ($N_2$, $O_2$), creating Nitrogen Oxides ($NO_x$).
3.  **Smog:** The $NO_x$ would block the sun (Global Cooling) and destroy the Ozone layer entirely.
4.  **UV Apocalypse:** The Sun's UV would then sterilize the surface.
This is likely what caused the **Ordovician Extinction** (450 million years ago), wiping out 85% of life.

## 2. Are we safe?
WR 104.
A Wolf-Rayet star 8,000 light years away.
It is a ticking time bomb.
It *appears* to be pointing its pole at us.
If it blows...
Probability: Low. The beam is very narrow (like a laser pointer).
But it is the ultimate "Rogue Wave" of the universe. We would have zero warning. Gamma rays travel at the speed of light. We would see the flash and die simultaneously.

### Fact Box
*   **Long vs Short GRB:**
    *   **Long (>2s):** Hypernova (Star collapse).
    *   **Short (<2s):** Neutron Star Merger. These also create Gravitational Waves.

## Introduction: The Lonely Universe
Before 1992, we knew of 9 planets (Pluto included). All in our system.
We assumed other stars had planets, but we couldn't prove it.
Today, we know **5,500+ Exoplanets**.
How?

## 1. The Transit Method (Kepler/TESS)
Stare at a star.
Wait for a planet to cross in front of it (Eclipse).
The brightness drops by 0.01%.
It repeats every year (Orbit).
**Limitations:**
It only works if the solar system is perfectly aligned edge-on to us.
If it is tilted, the planet never crosses the star. We miss 99% of planets this way.
But Kepler stared at 150,000 stars and found thousands.

## 2. The Radial Velocity (Wobble) Method
(See Doppler Effect in Batch 70).
The gravity of Jupiter pulls the Sun. The Sun moves in a small circle.
We measure the star's wobble using Redshift.
This finds massive planets (Hot Jupiters) close to the star.
It is hard to find Earths (too small to wobble the star).

## 3. Direct Imaging
Block the star's light with a "Coronagraph" (Starshade).
Look for the faint dot next to it.
We have only done this for huge young planets far from their stars.
**The Roman Telescope (Future):**
Will use an origami Starshade flying 50,000 km in front of the telescope to cast a perfect shadow, revealing Earth-like planets.

## 4. Spectroscopy (Sniffing the Air)
When a planet transits, some starlight passes *through* the planet's atmosphere.
The atmosphere absorbs specific colors (e.g., Oxygen absorbs red).
We analyze the Missing Colors (Absorption Spectrum).
If we see Oxygen + Methane... that is a BIOSIGNATURE.
Oxygen reacts with Methane quickly. Finding both means something (Life) is constantly replenishing them.
JWST does this now.

### Fact Box
*   **TRAPPIST-1:** A star with 7 Earth-sized planets packed tight. 3 of them are in the Habitable Zone (Liquid Water). If you stood on one, you would see the other planets in the sky looking as big as the Moon.
