## Introduction: You've Got Mail
If you grew up in the 90s, you know The Sound.
The screeches, the static, the "Welcome."
It was the sound of your computer calling another computer on the telephone network.
It was slow (56 kbps). Downloading a song took 30 minutes.
And if your mom picked up the phone, the internet died.

## 1. The Handshake
The noise wasn't static. It was **Data**.
The modem (MOdulator-DEModulator) was turning digital 1s and 0s into audible beeps.
*   **The Dial Tone:** Checking if the line is free.
*   **The Screech:** "Hello, I am a modem."
*   **The Static:** "I can hear you. Let's negotiate speed."
*   **The Silence:** Connection established.
The modem was literally shouting binary code down a copper wire meant for human voices.

## 2. Pshhhkkkkrrrr
Why was it so loud?
So you would know what was happening.
If you heard a busy signal, you knew to try again.
If you heard voices, you knew someone was on the line.
Once connected, the speaker turned off, but the screaming continued silently.

## 3. 56k Limitation
Why 56k?
Because the phone network (POTS) was designed to carry human voice frequencies (300Hz to 3400Hz).
Shannon's Law creates a mathematical limit on how much data you can squeeze into that narrow frequency.
 Broadband (DSL/Fiber) uses different frequencies, which is why it's silent and fast.
Dial-up was a hack that changed the world.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dial-Up Internet** used the existing telephone network to transmit data by converting digital signals into audible sounds (Modulation). The iconic "screeching" noise was the **Handshake** process, where two modems negotiated protocols and connection speeds. It was limited to 56 kbps due to the narrow frequency bandwidth of copper telephone lines.

## Introduction: The Save Icon
Show a 10-year-old a Floppy Disk. They say: "Cool 3D printed Save Icon."
It is the only technology that became a hieroglyph.
For 20 years, it was the standard for data transfer.
It held **1.44 MB**.
That is smaller than a single iPhone photo.
To install Windows 95, you needed 13 disks. If Disk 12 failed, you cried.

## 1. Why C Drive?
Have you ever wondered why your Hard Drive is always **C:**?
Where are **A:** and **B:**?
In the early PCs (IBM 5150), there were no Hard Drives.
**A:** was the Boot Floppy.
**B:** was the Data Floppy.
When Hard Drives were invented, they became the third drive: **C:**.
The legacy of the floppy is burned into every Windows PC today.

## 2. Still in Use?
Believe it or not, the US Nuclear Weapons Force used 8-inch floppy disks until **2019**.
Why? Because they are unhackable. You can't put a virus on a floppy if it isn't connected to the internet.
Boeing 747s receive software updates via Floppy Disk.
Old tech is safe tech.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Floppy Disk** was the primary data storage medium from the 1970s to the late 1990s. The standard 3.5-inch disk held **1.44 MB** of data using magnetic storage. Its legacy remains in the "Save" icon used in software and the drive letter convention in Windows (where the Hard Drive is **C:** because A: and B: were reserved for floppies).

## Introduction: The Private Concert
In 1979, Sony co-founder Akio Morita wanted to listen to opera on planes.
He asked his engineers to strip the recording function off a tape recorder and make it smaller.
They created the **TPS-L2 Walkman**.
It was controversial. "People won't buy a tape player that can't record!"
They sold 200 million of them.

## 1. The Social Shift
Before the Walkman, listening to music was a communal activity (Home Hifi, Jukebox, Boombox).
The Walkman made it **Private**.
People started wearing headphones in public.
Critics said it was "isolating" and "antisocial."
It was the first time you could create your own soundtrack for the world.

## 2. The Pencil Trick
The batteries (AA) were precious.
Rewinding a tape used a lot of power.
So every kid in the 80s knew the trick: stick a pencil in the spool and spin it manually.
It also fixed the tape when the player "ate" it (spooled it out into a tangled mess).
It was a tactile relationship with media that streaming has lost.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Sony Walkman**, released in 1979, revolutionized the way humans consume music by making it portable and **private**. It introduced the concept of the "personal playlist" (via Cassette Mixtapes) and normalized wearing headphones in public, paving the way for the iPod and modern streaming services.

## Introduction: The Question
In 1943, Edwin Land's daughter asked him: "Why can't I see the picture now?"
Land went for a walk. In one hour, he designed the chemical system for instant photography.
The **SX-70** (released in 1972) was a masterpiece.
You press a button. The camera ejects a square sheet.
In 60 seconds, an image appears like magic.

## 1. How It Works
Inside the white border of the film, there are tiny pods of developer, dye, and fixer.
When the film is ejected, it passes through rollers.
The rollers squeeze the pods, spreading the chemicals evenly across the image.
It is an entire chemical darkroom process happening in the palm of your hand.

## 2. Don't Shake It
Outkast's "Hey Ya!" told us to "Shake it like a Polaroid picture."
**Don't do that.**
Shaking it creates bubbles in the developing fluid and ruins the image.
You are supposed to lay it flat and keep it warm.

## 3. The Collapse
Digital cameras killed Polaroid. They went bankrupt in 2001.
But a group of fans ("The Impossible Project") bought the last factory in the Netherlands.
They saved the machines. They relearned the chemistry.
Today, Polaroid is back. Because in a digital world, physical artifacts are valuable again.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Polaroid Camera**, invented by Edwin Land, allowed for instant photo development by integrating the developing chemicals directly into the film packet. Upon ejection, rollers burst reagent pods to start the chemical reaction. Despite going bankrupt in the digital age, the brand was revived by enthusiasts who recognized the enduring appeal of physical, imperfect, instant hard copies.

## Introduction: The Egg
In 1996, Aki Maita at Bandai had an idea.
She wanted a pet, but she lived in a small apartment.
She created the **Tamagotchi** (Egg Watch).
It had three buttons.
You had to feed it, play with it, and clean up its virtual poop.

## 1. The Beeping
It didn't pause. Even when you were at school.
If it beeped and you ignored it, it got sick.
Teachers hated them. They were banned in schools worldwide.
Kids would hide them in their pockets, frantically pressing buttons during math class to stop their alien from dying.

## 2. The Death
The most shocking feature was **Death**.
If you neglected it, it didn't just restart.
It showed a tombstone (or a UFO taking it back to its planet).
It was permanent. You had to reset the device and start over with a new egg.
Psychologists debated if it was healthy for children to mourn digital pixels.
It was the precursor to modern AI companions. We bond with things that need us.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Tamagotchi** released in 1996, created a global craze for "Digital Pets." The device required constant attention (feeding, cleaning) in real-time, creating a sense of responsibility and attachment in users. Its feature of permanent death (showing a gravestone/UFO) introduced a generation of children to the concept of loss in a virtual environment.
