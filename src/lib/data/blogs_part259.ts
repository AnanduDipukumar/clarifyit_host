## Introduction: Hotel Lorraine
April 4, 1968. Memphis, Tennessee.
MLK was tired. He had just given his \"Mountaintop\" speech ("I might not get there with you").
He stepped onto the balcony of Room 306.
A Remington Gamemaster rifle fired from a bathroom window across the street.

## 1. The Sniper
**James Earl Ray**, a petty criminal and escapee, pulled the trigger.
He fled to London but was caught at Heathrow Airport two months later.
He pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty, then spent the rest of his life claiming he was a patsy for a government conspiracy (Raoul).
The King family actually believed him.

## 2. The Aftermath
Riots exploded in 100 cities.
Washington D.C. burned for days.
It forced the passage of the **Civil Rights Act of 1968** (Fair Housing Act).
His death radicalized the movement, but his message of non-violence remains the global standard for protest.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Martin Luther King Jr.** was assassinated in 1968 by James Earl Ray (though conspiracies persist). His death triggered nationwide riots but also catalyzed the rapid passage of final Civil Rights legislation. He became the only non-president to have a federal holiday in his name.

## Introduction: The Dakota
December 8, 1980. New York City.
John Lennon signed an autograph for a chubby man in glasses.
Hours later, Lennon returned home.
The man was still there.
Mark David Chapman fired 5 hollow-point bullets.

## 1. The Motive
Chapman wasn't a spy. He was a loser.
He was obsessed with the book **The Catcher in the Rye**.
He believed Lennon was a \"Phony\" for singing \"Imagine no possessions\" while living in a mansion.
He killed Lennon not out of hate, but to steal his fame.
"I was nobody," he said. "And now I am somebody."

## 2. The Legacy
Lennon's death marked the end of the 60s optimism.
It proves the danger of **Parasocial Relationships**.
Chapman remains one of the most hated men in history, denied parole 12 times.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **John Lennon** was murdered by Mark David Chapman, a disturbed fan seeking notoriety. Chapman remained at the scene reading *The Catcher in the Rye*. The event shocked the world, highlighting the dangers of celebrity obsession and mental illness.

## Introduction: The Breakup
Malcolm X was the face of the **Nation of Islam (NOI)**.
He preached black separatism.
But after a pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj), he saw white and black Muslims praying together.
He changed. He softened his views on race but hardened his views on justice.
He called the NOI leader, Elijah Muhammad, a fraud.
That was a death sentence.

## 1. The Audubon Ballroom
February 21, 1965.
Malcolm walked onstage.
A disturbance started in the crowd ("Get your hand out of my pocket!").
It was a distraction.
Three men rushed the stage with a sawed-off shotgun and pistols.
He was shot 21 times.

## 2. The Legacy
While MLK is the saint of the movement, Malcolm X is the warrior.
His autobiography (written with Alex Haley) became one of the most influential books of the 20th century.
He taught: "Nobody can give you freedom. If you are a man, you take it."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Malcolm X** was assassinated by members of the Nation of Islam, the organization he had formerly led and then denounced. His evolution from radical separatist to Pan-Africanist human rights leader made him enemies on all sides. His rhetoric laid the foundation for the Black Power movement.

## Introduction: Sarajevo
June 28, 1914.
Archduke Franz Ferdinand (Heir to Austria) visited Bosnia.
Terrorists (The Black Hand) threw a grenade at his car.
It bounced off. The Archduke survived.
The terrorists scattered. FAILURE.

## 1. The Sandwich
One assassin, **Gavrilo Princip**, gave up and went to eat a sandwich at a deli.
The Archduke decided to visit the injured in the hospital.
His driver didn't know the way. He took a wrong turn.
He realized his mistake and stopped the car to reverse... right in front of the deli.
Princip looked up. The target was 5 feet away.
Bang. Bang.

## 2. The Dominoes
Austria blamed Serbia. Russia helped Serbia. Germany helped Austria. France helped Russia.
WWI began.
If the driver hadn't missed the turn, the 20th century would have been completely different.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand** was the catalyst for World War I. Despite a failed initial attempt, a series of coincidences (a wrong turn by the driver) placed the Archduke directly in front of assassin Gavrilo Princip. This triggered a chain of alliances that dragged the world into war.

## Introduction: Nara
July 8, 2022.
Shinzo Abe was speaking on a street corner.
Security was lax. Japan is safe.
A man walked up behind him with a strange, taped-up device.
Two blasts of smoke.

## 1. The Motive
The killer, Tetsuya Yamagami, wasn't political.
His mother had bankrupted the family by donating all their money to the **Unification Church** (The Moonies).
He blamed Abe for supporting the church.
He built the gun himself using Youtube tutorials, wood, and pipes.

## 2. The Aftermath
It worked. The scandal exposed deep ties between the ruling party and the controversial church.
It was a shock that in the high-tech 21st century, the most powerful man in Japan could be killed by a weapon that looked like junk.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Shinzo Abe**, Japan's longest-serving Prime Minister, was assassinated in 2022 by a lone gunman using a homemade firearm. The assassin's motive was a grudge against the Unification Church, which he believed Abe supported. The event shocked a nation known for its exceptionally low gun violence.
