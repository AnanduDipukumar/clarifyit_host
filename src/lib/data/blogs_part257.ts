## Introduction: The Yogurt
Which yogurt would you buy?
A: "Contains 10% Fat."
B: "90% Fat-Free."
They are identical. But B sells way more.
Option A frames it as a **Loss** (Fat). Option B frames it as a **Gain** (Fat-Free).
This is the **Framing Effect**.

## 1. Life and Death
Kahneman asked doctors:
Proposal A: "90% survival rate."
Proposal B: "10% mortality rate."
Doctors chose Proposal A significantly more often, even though it's the same surgery.
Because we are **Loss Averse**, negative frames scare us more than positive frames encourage us.

## 2. Politics
"Tax Relief" (implies taxes are a burden).
"Public Investment" (implies taxes build things).
Politicians win or lose elections based on the frame, not the policy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Framing Effect** is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether they are presented with positive or negative connotations (e.g., as a loss or a gain). People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risk when a negative frame is presented.

## Introduction: The Chaos
The world is random. Earthquakes kill babies. Cancer strikes the kind.
This is terrifying.
To cope, the human brain invented a shield: **The Just-World Hypothesis**.
"Good things happen to good people. Bad things happen to bad people."

## 1. Victim Blaming
If you see someone homeless, the hypothesis whispers: "They must be lazy."
If you see a crime victim, it whispers: "They shouldn't have been walking there."
It isn't malice; it's self-defense.
If the victim was *innocent* and got hurt, then *you* (who are also innocent) could get hurt.
By finding a fault in the victim, you reassure yourself that you are safe.

## 2. Karma
This is the dark side of Karma.
While it encourages good behavior, it also justifies suffering.
Breaking this bias requires accepting that the universe is indifferent to your morality.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Just-World Hypothesis** is the cognitive bias that assumes the world is fundamentally fair—that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences. This leads to **Victim Blaming**, as observers rationalize suffering by searching for things the victim did to "deserve" it, in order to maintain their own sense of security.

## Introduction: The Famous Photo
In 1948, Harry Truman held up a newspaper declaring him the loser. He had just won the presidency.
The Chicago Tribune had trusted a poll.
The poll called people on the telephone to ask who they voted for.

## 1. The Flaw
In 1948, telephones were expensive.
Rich people had phones. Poor people didn't.
Rich people voted for Dewey (Republican). Poor people voted for Truman (Democrat).
The data wasn't wrong; the **Sample** was wrong.
This is **Selection Bias**.

## 2. WWII Planes
Remember the planes with bullet holes? (Survivorship Bias).
That is a type of Selection Bias.
If you survey "Customers who bought our product," you miss "People who hated it and didn't buy it."
Data is only as good as the filter it passed through.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Selection Bias** occurs when the individuals used in a study or analysis are not properly randomized, meaning the sample is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. This leads to distorted conclusions, such as the 1948 election polling error, where the method of data collection (telephones) inadvertently filtered out a specific demographic.

## Introduction: The Stat
Ask a room of people: "Are you a better-than-average driver?"
90% of hands go up.
Mathematically impossible.
This is the **Optimism Bias**.

## 1. The Shield
Every smoker knows smoking causes cancer.
But deep down, they feel: "That happens to *other* smokers. I have good genes."
Couples marry knowing the divorce rate is 50%. They assume their risk is 0%.
Without this bias, we might never start businesses, get married, or have kids.
We need hope to act.

## 2. The Project
It causes the **Planning Fallacy**.
"I can write this essay in 2 hours." (It takes 6).
We imagine the best-case scenario, not the likely scenario.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Optimism Bias** (or Unrealistic Optimism) is a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they themselves are less likely to experience a negative event (like divorce, car accident, or illness) than others. While it promotes mental health and ambition, it can lead to poor decision-making regarding health risks and financial planning.

## Introduction: The Monday Morning Quarterback
On Sunday, the game is unpredictable.
On Monday, the coach's decision seems "obviously stupid."
Once we know the outcome, our brain overwrites our memory of the uncertainty.
We convert "Possibility" into "Inevitability."

## 1. Rewriting History
This is **Hindsight Bias**.
It makes us harsh judges.
"The CEO should have known the product would fail."
Did *you* know?
We forget the fog of war that existed at the moment of decision.

## 2. The Danger
It prevents learning.
If you think the crash was "obvious," you won't study the real complex causes.
"It won't happen again, because now I know."
(You don't know).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hindsight Bias** (the "I-knew-it-all-along" phenomenon) is the tendency of people to overestimate their ability to have predicted an outcome that could not possibly have been predicted. Past events seem simple and inevitable only because we view them through the lens of the present knowledge, ignoring the complexity and uncertainty that existed at the time.
