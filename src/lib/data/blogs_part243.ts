## Introduction: Free Money
In the 2000s, banks gave mortgages to *everyone*.
No Income, No Job, No Assets (NINJA Loans).
Why? Because house prices always go up... right?

## 1. The Sausage Machine (CDO)
Banks didn't keep the loans. They sold them to Wall Street.
Wall Street bundled thousands of bad loans into a bond called a **CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation)**.
Rating agencies gave these piles of garbage a "AAA" rating (Safe as Gold).
Investors bought them, thinking they were safe 5% returns.

## 2. The Pop
In 2007, the variable interest rates went up.
People couldn't pay. They defaulted.
Suddenly, the "Safe" CDOs were worthless.
Banks (Lehman Brothers) held billions of them.
The system froze. No one trusted anyone.
It took \$700 Billion in government bailouts to stop the world from ending.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **2008 Financial Crisis** was caused by the bursting of the US Housing Bubble. Banks issued high-risk **Subprime Mortgages**, which were bundled into complex financial products (**CDOs**) and sold globally. When homeowners defaulted, the value of these assets collapsed, causing the failure of major financial institutions like Lehman Brothers.

## Introduction: Margin
In the 1920s, everyone played the stock market.
Shoeshine boys gave stock tips.
But they were buying on **Margin** (Borrowing 90% of the money).
If you have \$10, you can buy \$100 of stock.
If it goes up, you're rich.
If it goes down... you lose everything instantly.

## 1. The Panic
October 29, 1929.
The market stuttered.
Panic selling started.
Because of Margin, brokers forced people to sell to cover their debts (Margin Call).
This forced prices lower -> More Margin Calls -> More Selling.
The market fell 89% over the next 3 years.

## 2. The Great Depression
Banks failed (they had invested your savings in the market).
People lost their life savings.
Unemployment hit 25%.
It proved that the "Invisible Hand" sometimes drops the ball.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Wall Street Crash of 1929** was the most devastating stock market crash in US history. It was fueled by excessive optimism and **Buying on Margin** (debt). The crash signaled the beginning of the **Great Depression**, a decade-long economic slump that affected the entire Western world.

## Introduction: The Strategy
Ty Warner (Founder of Ty Inc) was a genius.
He sold Beanie Babies for \$5. Cheap.
But he "Retired" certain animals randomly.
Once retired, no more were made.
Collectors panicked. "I need the Royal Blue Peanut Elephant!"

## 1. The Madness
Secondary prices exploded.
A \$5 bear sold for \$5,000.
Families spent their life savings hoarding bears.
A divorced couple famously sat on a courtroom floor dividing their Beanie Baby collection.

## 2. The Crash
Ty increased production.
eBay flooded with sellers.
Everyone realized, "Wait... it's just a bag of beans."
The bubble popped.
Most collections are now worth \$0.
It is the perfect example of **Greater Fool Theory** (Buying something useless hoping a greater fool will pay more).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Beanie Babies Bubble** (1995-1999) was a speculative frenzy over stuffed animals. Fueled by the manufacturer's strategy of "retiring" products to create scarcity, collectors treated the toys as high-yield investments. When the supply increased and the fad passed, the market collapsed, leaving speculators with worthless inventory.

## Introduction: The Miracle
Post-war Japan was an economic machine.
Sony, Toyota, Nintendo.
By the 1980s, money was cheap (Low Interest Rates).
Corporations poured money into Land and Stocks.
The Nikkei index hit 38,915.

## 1. The Height
Golf club memberships sold for \$3 Million.
People said Japan would buy America.
And they did (Rockefeller Center).
But the prices were detached from reality. A tiny apartment shouldn't cost \$10 Million.

## 2. The Lost Decade
In 1991, the Bank of Japan raised rates to pop the bubble.
It worked too well.
Prices crashed.
Companies were left with massive debt and assets worth nothing ("Zombie Companies").
Japan entered the **Lost Decade** (Stagnation).
They didn't recover for 30 years.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Japanese Asset Price Bubble** (1986-1991) was an era where real estate and stock prices in Japan became massively inflated. When the bubble burst, it led to a prolonged period of economic stagnation known as the **Lost Decade**, characterized by deflation and low growth.

## Introduction: The New Tech
The Steam Engine was the "Internet" of the 1840s.
It changed everything.
Investors saw the success of the first lines (Liverpool to Manchester).
They threw money at *any* company with "Railway" in the name.
The Bronte sisters invested. Charles Darwin invested.

## 1. The Scam
Schemers drew lines on maps connecting tiny villages.
Parliament approved thousands of miles of track.
Duplicate lines were built next to each other.
Laborers (Navvies) were paid fortunes.

## 2. The Legacy
The bubble popped in 1846.
Investments were wiped out.
BUT... unlike Beanie Babies, the railways *remained*.
The bubble successfully built the infrastructure of modern Britain.
Sometimes bubbles are destructive; sometimes they accelerate the future.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Railway Mania** was a speculative bubble in the United Kingdom in the 1840s. The pattern followed the classic "Technological Boom" cycle: excitement over new technology (steam trains) led to over-investment, fraud, and a crash. However, the legacy was a completed national rail network that boosted the Industrial Revolution.
