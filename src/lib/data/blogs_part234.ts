## Introduction: Dictator Perpetuo
Julius Caesar had just won the Civil War.
He was named Dictator for Life.
The Senators feared he would crown himself King (Rex), destroying the Republic.
They decided to save Democracy by stabbing him.

## 1. The Ides of March
March 15th, 44 BC.
Caesar walked into the Theatre of Pompey.
Tillius Cimber grabbed his toga (the signal).
They swarmed him.
Caesar fought back until he saw Marcus Brutus.
His friend. Maybe his son (rumors).
He stopped fighting. "You too, child?" (Not "Et Tu Brute", that's Shakespeare).

## 2. The Irony
The assassins thought the people would celebrate "Freedom".
Instead, the poor (who loved Caesar) rioted.
They burned the Senators' houses.
Another Civil War started.
It ended with Augustus Caesar becoming the **First Emperor**.
The assassination created the exact thing they tried to prevent.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Assassination of Julius Caesar** was the result of a conspiracy by Roman Senators, led by Brutus and Cassius, who feared Caesar's growing power would end the Roman Republic. Ironically, the resulting power vacuum and public outrage led directly to the end of the Republic and the rise of the **Roman Empire**.

## Introduction: The Actor
John Wilkes Booth was famous.
He was the Brad Pitt of 1865. A celebrated actor.
He was also a Confederate sympathizer.
He planned to kidnap Lincoln, but after Lee surrendered, he decided to kill him.

## 1. The Shot
April 14, 1865. Ford's Theatre. play: *Our American Cousin*.
Lincoln was laughing at a joke.
Booth knew the play by heart. He waited for the biggest laugh line ("You sockdologizing old man-trap") to mask the gunshot.
He shot Lincoln in the back of the head.
He jumped onto the stage, broke his leg, shouted "Sic Semper Tyrannis" (Thus always to tyrants), and fled.

## 2. The Manhunt
It triggered the largest manhunt in US history.
Booth was found 12 days later in a barn in Virginia.
He refused to surrender. They set the barn on fire.
A soldier shot him.
Lincoln's death made him a martyr. If he had lived, Reconstruction might have been very different.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Abraham Lincoln** was assassinated by **John Wilkes Booth** on April 14, 1865, just days after the Confederate surrender ended the Civil War. It was the first assassination of a U.S. president.

## Introduction: Dallas
November 22, 1963.
President Kennedy was driving through Dealey Plaza in an open-top limo.
Shots fired.
The President was hit in the neck and head.
Governor Connally was also hit.

## 1. The Oswald Problem
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested.
He denied it ("I'm just a patsy").
Two days later, on live TV, Jack Ruby (a nightclub owner) walked up and shot Oswald dead.
Dead men tell no tales.

## 2. The Warren Commission
The government report said Oswald acted alone.
They proposed the **"Magic Bullet Theory"**: One bullet passed through JFK and then hit Connally, zig-zagging in mid-air.
Physics says it's possible (tumbling bullet).
But the public never bought it.
CIA? Mafia? Castro?
It remains the mother of all conspiracy theories.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Assassination of John F. Kennedy** remains one of the most debated events in modern history. While the **Warren Commission** concluded that **Lee Harvey Oswald** acted alone as a lone gunman, the subsequent murder of Oswald, the strange ballistics, and the geopolitical tension of the Cold War have fueled decades of skepticism and alternative theories.

## Introduction: Partition
1947. India won independence.
But it was split into India (Hindu) and Pakistan (Muslim).
Millions died in the riots.
Gandhi, an old man, walked barefoot through the violence, fasting to stop the killing.
He demanded India pay Pakistan its share of the treasury (55 Crore).

## 1. The Extremist
Nathuram Godse was a Hindu nationalist.
He believed Gandhi was betraying Hindus by appeasing Muslims.
January 30, 1948.
Gandhi was walking to prayer.
Godse bowed to him, then shot him 3 times in the chest.
"Hey Ram" (Oh God).

## 2. The Legacy
Godse was hanged.
He didn't hate Gandhi the man; he hated Gandhi's ideology of absolute non-violence.
Ironically, Gandhi's death stopped the riots. The nation was too shocked to keep killing.
In death, he united them one last time.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Mahatma Gandhi** was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by **Nathuram Godse**, a Hindu nationalist who believed Gandhi was too accommodating to Muslims during the Partition of India. Gandhi's philosophy of **Satyagraha** (non-violent resistance) had successfully led India to independence, but his assassination highlighted the deep religious fractures that still plague the region.

## Introduction: The Healer
Rasputin was a peasant mystic.
He was the only one who could stop the bleeding of the Tsar's son (Hemophilia).
The Empress believed he was sent by God.
The Nobles believed he was a German spy and a sex maniac (sleeping with the aristocracy).
Prince Yusupov decided to kill him.

## 1. The Party
They invited him to the Moika Palace for tea.
They fed him cakes laced with enough **Cyanide** to kill 5 men.
Rasputin ate them. He drank poisoned wine.
He didn't die. He just asked for more wine.

## 2. The Shots
Yusupov panicked and shot him in the chest.
They checked the body. No pulse.
Suddenly, Rasputin opened his eyes and grabbed Yusupov's throat.
He ran into the courtyard.
They shot him again. They beat him with clubs. They threw him into the freezing Neva River.
Autopsy: He died of drowning. (Or maybe a bullet to the head—history is murky).
3 months later, the Revolution started.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Assassination of Rasputin** (1916) is legendary for the difficulty the conspirators had in killing him. Grigori Rasputin, a mystic with undue influence over the Russian Imperial family, was poisoned, shot, beaten, and drowned. His death signaled the collapsing authority of the Tsar, foreshadowing the **Russian Revolution**.
