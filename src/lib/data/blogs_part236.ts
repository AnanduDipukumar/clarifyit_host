## Introduction: The Horizon
Watch the sunset over the ocean.
The very last sliver of the sun disappears.
For a split second, it blinks Emerald Green.
Most people miss it.
Jules Verne wrote a novel about it ("Le Rayon Vert").

## 1. Dispersion
The atmosphere acts like a prism.
It bends (Refracts) light.
Blue/Green light bends more than Red/Orange light.
So the "Green Sun" is slightly higher in the sky than the "Red Sun".
When the Red Sun sets below the horizon, the Green Sun is still visible for a fleeting moment.

## 2. Why Not Blue?
Blue bends even more. Shouldn't we see a "Blue Flash"?
Usually, the atmosphere scatters the blue light away (Rayleigh Scattering).
But on very clear days, you can actually see a Blue Flash or even a Violet Flash.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Green Flash** is an optical phenomenon that occurs shortly after sunset or before sunrise. It happens because the Earth's atmosphere causes the light from the sun to separate into different colors (dispersion). Green light is refracted more than red light, so it remains visible for a second after the red light has been blocked by the Earth.

## Introduction: Viscosity
Newton said **Viscosity** (thickness) is constant.
Water is water. Honey is honey.
But some fluids change their viscosity based on **Force**.
This is a **Non-Newtonian Fluid**.

## 1. Shear Thickening
**Oobleck** (Cornstarch + Water) is a Shear Thickening fluid.
When you hit it fast (High Shear), the cornstarch particles lock together (Jamming). It becomes solid.
You can literally run across a pool of it.
If you stop running, you sink.

## 2. Shear Thinning
Ketchup is the opposite (Shear Thinning).
It is thick in the bottle.
But if you hit the bottle (Force), it becomes runny.
Quicksand is also Shear Thinning (The more you struggle, the more liquid it becomes... wait, actually Quicksand behavior is complex, but the struggling usually liquifies the sand packing).
Blood is also Shear Thinning (it flows easier when pumped fast).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Non-Newtonian Fluid** is a fluid whose viscosity is variable based on applied stress. **Shear Thickening** fluids (like Oobleck or Kevlar armor fluid) harden under impact. **Shear Thinning** fluids (like Ketchup, Paint, or Blood) become runnier under stress.

## Introduction: Density
Light travels slower through dense air (Cold) than thin air (Hot).
This change in speed bends the light (Refraction).
Usually, the bend is too subtle for our eyes.
(Except heat haze on a road).

## 1. The Setup
**Schlieren Photography** amplifies this bending.
You shine a light past an object into a camera.
You block *half* the light with a razor blade.
Any light that bends slightly UP hits the clear part.
Any light that bends slightly DOWN hits the blade (Darkness).
This creates a high-contrast image of the air itself.

## 2. Applications
We can see the heat rising from a candle.
We can see the shockwaves of a supersonic jet.
We can see the aerosol cloud of a cough (explaining how viruses spread).
It makes the invisible visible.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Schlieren photography** is a visual process that photographically records the flow of fluids of varying density. Invented by German physicist August Toepler in 1864, it exploits the refraction of light to image shock waves, heat rising, and breath, famously used by NASA to study wind tunnel airflow.

## Introduction: The Drop
Melt glass. Drop it into a bucket of cold water.
It freezes instantly into a tadpole shape.
This is a **Prince Rupert's Drop**.
(Prince Rupert brought them to England in 1660 to prank the King).

## 1. Tension vs Compression
The outside cools fast (Hard Shell).
The inside cools slow (Shrinking).
As the inside shrinks, it pulls the outside in tight.
The head is under massive **Compressive Stress** (up to 700 megapascals).
That's why a hammer can't break it. It's pre-stressed.

## 2. The Achilles Heel
But the tail is the release valve.
If you snip the tiny tail, you release the tension.
A crack races down the drop at 4,000 mph (hypersonic).
The tension releases explosively.
The drop vaporizes into dust.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Prince Rupert's Drop** is a toughened glass bead created by dripping molten glass into huge, cold water. The high residual stress makes the bulbous head incredibly strong (hammer-proof), but the tail is a point of catastrophic failure. Breaking the tail triggers a chain reaction that disintegrates the entire drop explosively.

## Introduction: The Review
Normal valves (Heart valve, Bicycle tire) have a flap.
Flaps break.
Nikola Tesla wanted a valve that would last forever.
In 1916, he patented the **Valvular Conduit**.

## 1. The Design
It looks like a series of loops.
**Forward direction:** The water flows straight through the center. Easy.
**Reverse direction:** The water is diverted into the loops. It loops back and crashes into the main stream.
It creates a traffic jam of water.
The harder you push, the more it resists.

## 2. Microfluidics
For 100 years, it was a curiosity.
Now, we use it in micro-engines and chemical processing.
Since it has no moving parts, it never jams or wears out.
Tesla was (as usual) 100 years ahead of his time.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Tesla Valve** is a fixed-geometry passive check valve. It allows fluid to flow preferentially in one direction, without any moving parts. It achieves this through a series of loops that cause reverse-flow fluid to interfere with itself (turbulence), drastically increasing resistance.
