## Introduction: Dynamic Perspective
Amazon dominated books (Kindle) and tablets (Fire).
Jeff Bezos wanted a phone.
He personally micromanaged the project.
The selling point was **Dynamic Perspective**.
The phone had 4 cameras on the front corners. They tracked your eyes.
If you tilted the phone, the screen adjusted the 3D perspective. It looked like a hologram.

## 1. The Problem
It was a gimmick.
It drained the battery. It made people nauseous. And it didn't solve a problem.
Worse, the phone cost $649 (same as an iPhone) but didn't have Google Apps (no YouTube, no Gmail, no Maps).
It only had the Amazon App Store.
And the main feature ("Firefly") was just a button to scan products... so you could buy them on Amazon.
Consumers realized: "I am paying $650 to carry a shopping scanner for Jeff Bezos."

## 2. The Write-Down
Amazon took a **$170 Million** loss.
They sold the remaining stock for $0.99.
It was Amazon's biggest hardware failure.
But it taught them a lesson: Don't build hardware unless it is cheap (Echo) or useful (Kindle).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Amazon Fire Phone** (2014) was a commercial disaster. Despite advanced features like "Dynamic Perspective" (using 4 front-facing cameras for 3D effects), it failed due to its high price ($649), lack of app ecosystem (no Google Play Store), and the perception that it was merely a tool to drive Amazon sales. Amazon discontinued it within a year, taking a massive financial write-down.

        description: "It was actually a great product. The sound quality was better than the iPod. But it was brown. And it came out 5 years too late.",

## Introduction: The iPod Killer
In 2006, Microsoft launched the **Zune**.
It was their answer to the iPod (released 2001).
It had a bigger screen. It had an FM radio. It had Wi-Fi ("Squircle" social sharing).
Tech reviewers generally liked it.

## 1. The Brown Brick
But Microsoft made weird choices.
The flagship color was... **Brown**.
And the Wi-Fi sharing ("Welcome to the Social") had DRM restrictions—you could only listen to a shared song 3 times.
Who wants that?

## 2. Network Effect
By 2006, everyone had an iPod.
Everyone had bought songs on iTunes.
To switch to Zune, you had to lose your library.
**Lock-in** killed the Zune.
Microsoft eventually killed the hardware in 2011.
Ironically, the Zune's "Metro" typography design became the basis for Windows Phone and Windows 8.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Microsoft Zune** (2006-2011) is the archetypal "good product, bad timing" failure. Launched five years after the iPod, it failed to break Apple's market dominance despite having superior features like Wi-Fi sharing and an FM radio. Its failure was driven by the **Network Effect** of iTunes (user lock-in) and questionable aesthetic choices (the "brown" color), though its UI design language influenced Microsoft's software for a decade.

        description: "It raised $8.5 million on Kickstarter in 8 hours. It promised to kill the PlayStation and Xbox. It delivered a plastic cube with a laggy controller.",

## Introduction: The Dream
In 2012, **Julie Uhrman** pitched the **Ouya** on Kickstarter.
A $99 open-source Android console.
"The Television is broken. We are going to fix it."
Gamers loved the idea of freedom from Sony and Microsoft's closed gardens.
It became the second-highest earning Kickstarter ever.

## 1. The Reality
When it shipped in 2013, it was a disaster.
The controller buttons got stuck under the faceplate.
The input lag was noticeable.
The Wi-Fi was weak.
But worst of all: **There were no games.**
It played mobile games (like *Angry Birds*) on a TV. Why would you buy a console for that?

## 2. Free To Play
Ouya mandated that *every* game must have a "Free to Try" mode.
This sounded generous, but it killed developer revenue. 73% of gamers never paid a cent.
Developers fled.
Razer bought the company in 2015 and shut down the servers in 2019.
It proved that hardware is easy; **Ecosystem** is hard.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ouya** was an Android-based microconsole that raised a record-breaking $8.5 million on Kickstarter in 2012. Pitched as an open competitor to the major consoles, it failed due to poor hardware quality (controller issues, lag) and a lack of compelling exclusive games. Its mandatory "free-to-try" model alienated developers, leading to a quick demise and eventual acquisition by Razer.

## Introduction: Tom Anderson
In 2005, **Myspace** was the most visited website on the planet (more than Google).
It was chaotic.
Users learned HTML to customize their profiles with glitter backgrounds, auto-playing emo songs, and "Top 8" friends lists.
It was creative expression.

## 1. The Murdoch Effect
In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Myspace for **$580 Million**.
They didn't understand tech. They wanted ad revenue.
They cluttered the site with flashy ads.
The site became slow and buggy.
Meanwhile, **Facebook** launched. It was clean ("The Blue Garden"). It required real names. It didn't allow custom HTML. It loaded instantly.

## 2. The Exodus
In 2008, Facebook overtook Myspace.
Myspace tried to pivot to "Music," then "Entertainment," but it was too late.
In 2011, it was sold for just **$35 Million**.
Tom Anderson (everyone's first friend) took his payout and retired to travel the world as a photographer. He won.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Myspace** was the dominant social network of the mid-2000s, known for its high level of user customization (HTML/CSS). Its decline began after its acquisition by News Corp, which prioritized aggressive monetization (cluttering the UI with ads) over user experience. It lost the market to **Facebook**, which offered a cleaner, faster, and more standardized interface, illustrating the critical importance of performance and usability in social platforms.

## Introduction: Do It For The Vine
Launched in 2013 (owned by **Twitter**), Vine was simple.
You held the screen to record. You let go to stop.
The maximum length was **6 seconds**.
This constraint sparked incredible creativity (King Bach, Logan Paul, Shawn Mendes started here).
The videos looped endlessly.

## 1. The Stagnation
Despite its massive culture impact, Twitter didn't know how to monetize it.
They refused to pay the top creators (who were driving all the traffic).
In 2015, the top Viners (who had millions of followers) met with Twitter.
They demanded payment to keep posting.
Twitter said no.
The Viners left for YouTube and Instagram (which had just introduced video).

## 2. The End
In 2016, Twitter shut Vine down to cut costs.
It is widely considered one of the biggest missed opportunities in tech business history.
A year later, **ByteDance** bought Musical.ly, renamed it **TikTok**, used the exact same short-form looping format, and built a trillion-dollar company.
Twitter had the golden goose and cooked it for dinner.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Vine** (2013-2016) was a short-form video hosting service owned by Twitter that allowed users to share six-second looping video clips. Despite pioneering the format and engaging a massive youth user base, it failed due to Twitter's inability to monetize the platform or provide revenue sharing for its top creators, who subsequently migrated to YouTube and Instagram. Its void was later filled by **TikTok**.
