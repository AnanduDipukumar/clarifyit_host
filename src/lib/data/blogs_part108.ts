## Introduction: The Sonic Boom
The Shinkansen (Japan) goes 300km/h.
When it entered a tunnel, it pushed a wave of air.
When it exited, it created a "Sonic Boom" (Thunder clap).
Neighbors complained.
Engineer Eiji Nakatsu was a birdwatcher.

## 1. The Kingfisher
A Kingfisher dives from air (low density) into water (high density) without a splash.
How?
Its beak is long and tapered.
Nakatsu redesigned the train nose to match the Kingfisher beak.
Result: No geometric boom. 15% less energy. 10% faster.

## 2. Velcro (Burrs)
Swiss engineer George de Mestral walked his dog.
Burrs stuck to the dog's fur.
Microscope: The burrs had tiny **Hooks**. The fur was **Loops**.
He invented Velcro.

## 3. Shark Skin
Sharks are fast. Bacteria doesn't grow on them.
Their skin has "Denticles" (Tiny teeth).
They break up turbulence (reducing drag).
Olympic swimmers wore Shark Skin suits in 2008. They broke so many records the suits were banned.
Hospitals use shark-skin patterns on door handles to stop bacteria (antibacterial by geometry).

### Fact Box
*   **Spider Silk:** It is 5x stronger than steel (by weight). If we could weave it, we could build space elevators. We haven't figured out how to farm spiders (they eat each other), so we are splicing spider genes into goats to milk the silk. (Spider-Goats).

## Introduction: Darwin vs Lamarck
Darwin: Evolution takes millions of years. Random Mutation.
Lamarck: "If a Giraffe stretches its neck, its baby gets a longer neck."
We mocked Lamarck. He was wrong.
But... Epigenetics shows he was *partially* right.

## 1. The Dutch Hunger Winter (1944)
Nazis blocked food to the Netherlands.
Women were starving. Ate tulip bulbs.
They gave birth.
The babies were small.
But 60 years later... those babies (now adults) had high rates of Obesity and Schizophrenia.
And *their* children (Grandchildren of the famine) also had health issues.
The starvation turned "Thrifty Genes" ON. And they *stayed* ON for generations.

## 2. Methylation (The Switch)
DNA is the Hardware.
Epigenetics is the Software.
Methyl groups (Chemical tags) attach to DNA to switch genes On or Off.
Trauma, Diet, Stress... change the tags.
The tags are passed to the sperm/egg.

## 3. Cherry Blossom Mice
Experiment: Spray Cherry Blossom scent + Shock the mouse.
Mouse fears the scent.
Mouse has babies. (Babies never shocked).
Babies fear the scent.
Grandbabies fear the scent.
**Intergenerational Trauma.**
The memory of the fear was physically written onto the sperm.

### Fact Box
*   **Twin Studies:** Identical twins have 100% same DNA. But as they age, they look different. One gets cancer, one doesn't. Why? Epigenetics drift. Their lives (Smoking, Stress) write different code on the same hard drive.
