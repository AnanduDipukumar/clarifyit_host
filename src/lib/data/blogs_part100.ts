## Introduction: The Dream
Ptolemy I Soter (Alexander's General) wanted to collect "All the books in the world".
He built the Mouseion (Temple of Muses) in Alexandria, Egypt.
It held 500,000 scrolls.
Ships docking in Alexandria were searched. Any books found were seized, copied, and the copy was returned. The original stayed.
It was the Internet of the ancient world.

## 1. The Destruction (Who did it?)
It wasn't one fire. It was a slow death.
*   **Julius Caesar (48 BC):** In a civil war, he set fire to his own ships in the harbor. The fire spread to the Library warehouses. Accidental arson.
*   **Theophilus (391 AD):** A Christian Bishop who mobbed the Serapeum (sister library) to destroy "Pagan idols".
*   **Caliph Omar (642 AD):** Legend says he ordered: "If the books agree with the Quran, they are superfluous. If they disagree, they are heresy. Burn them." (Likely a myth).
By 642, the library was probably already a ruin due to budget cuts.

## 2. What did we lose?
We have 7 plays by Sophocles. He wrote 120.
We have 0 plays by Agathon.
**Hero of Alexandria:** He invented a Steam Engine (Aeolipile) and a Coin-operated vending machine.
If the library survived... would we have had the Industrial Revolution in 100 AD?
Probably not. They had slaves. Why build machines when labor is free?

## 3. The Digital Alexandria
Today we have the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine).
It holds petabytes.
But link rot is real.
Digital formats (Floppy, CD-ROM) rot faster than Papyrus.
We are creating a "Digital Dark Age".
If the power goes out... we lose everything. Papyrus lasts 2000 years. Hard drives last 10.

### Fact Box
*   **Hypatia:** The last head librarian. A female mathematician and astronomer. In 415 AD, a Christian mob dragged her from her chariot, stripped her, and flayed her alive with oyster shells (tiles). Her death marked the end of classical learning.

## Introduction: The First Global Economy
1200 BC.
The world was interconnected.
Egypt sold gold. Cyprus sold copper. Afghanistan sold tin.
They sent letters to each other ("My brother, send me gold").
It was a golden age of trade and diplomacy.
Then, the lights went out.

## 1. The Sea Peoples
Inscriptions in Egypt say: "They came from the sea in their warships. No land could stand before them."
They burned Hattusa (Hittite Capital). They burned Mycenae (Troy).
Who were they?
Philistines? Sardinians (Sherden)? Sicilian (Shekelesh)?
Likely refugees fleeing famine.

## 2. The Perfect Storm (Systems Collapse)
It wasn't just invaders.
1.  **Drought:** Pollen cores show a 300-year dry spell. Famine strikes.
2.  **Earthquakes:** A "Storm of Earthquakes" hit the fault lines.
3.  **Trade Collapse:** Once the copper stopped, nobody could make Bronze. No weapons. No tools.
The Sea Peoples were the *symptom*, not the cause.
When complex systems fail, they fail in a cascade (Domino Effect).

## 3. The Dark Age
After 1177 BC, writing disappeared in Greece (Linear B).
Pottery became ugly.
Cities were abandoned.
It took 400 years for civilization to reboot (Iron Age).
It is a warning: Progress is not a straight line. We can go backwards.

### Fact Box
*   **Iron:** The collapse forced people to find a substitute for Tin (which was rare). They found Iron (which is everywhere). Iron is harder to forge, but once they learned... the Bronze Age elite (who controlled the Tin trade) lost their power. Iron democratized warfare.

## Introduction: The Sponge Divers
1901. Greek divers looking for sponges near Antikythera island found a shipwreck.
They hauled up statues... and a green lump of rock.
It sat in a museum for 50 years.
Then Derek de Solla Price looked at it. "These are gears."

## 1. The Clockwork
It dates to ~150 BC.
It has 30 bronze gears. Differential gears (invented in 1827?).
You turn a crank on the side.
The hands on the front show:
*   Position of Sun and Moon.
*   Phase of the Moon.
*   Next Eclipse.
*   Date of the next Olympic Games.
It is an **Analog Computer**.

## 2. Epicycles
The Greeks believed the Earth was the center (Geocentric).
But planets move weirdly (Retrograde Motion).
To model this, they used "Epicycles" (Gears on gears).
The mechanism models the *variable speed* of the Moon (Kepler's laws) using a pin-and-slot gear.
This level of math was thought impossible until the 14th century.

## 3. Where did it go?
If they could build this... why didn't they build clocks? Or factories?
Bronze is valuable. People melt it down to make swords.
Only shipwrecks save bronze from the recycling bin.
There were probably thousands of these. We found one.

### Fact Box
*   **Archimedes:** Cicero wrote that Archimedes built a sphere that showed the motions of the planets. This might be that very device (or a copy). The genius of the Greeks was lost for a millennium.

## Introduction: Wilfrid Voynich
1912. A Polish book dealer finds a strange book in an Italian Jesuit college.
Carbon dated to 1404-1438.
Vellum pages.
Illustrated with naked women bathing in green tubes, and plants that are hybrids (Root of one, flower of another).
The text is a unique alphabet ("Voynichese").

## 1. The Code Breakers
WWII cryptographers (William Friedman) tried to break it. Failed.
AI tried to break it. Failed.
It follows Zipf's Law (The distribution of words looks like a real language).
It has entropy similar to English or Latin.
But it means nothing.

## 2. Theories
*   **Hoax:** A medieval fraud to sell a "Magic Book" to a rich Emperor (Rudolf II paid 600 ducats). If so, it is a *very* elaborate hoax.
*   **Lost Language:** A dialect of Nahuatl (Aztec)? Or a phonetic code for Hebrew?
*   **Micrography:** Some claim there are tiny letters hidden inside the big letters.
*   **Glossolalia:** Written by someone speaking in tongues (mental illness).

## 3. The Solution?
In 2019, a researcher claimed it was "Proto-Romance".
In 2020, another said "Hebrew".
None are accepted.
It remains the holy grail of cryptography.
Or the greatest troll in history.

### Fact Box
*   **The Plants:** Botanists have identified some plants (Sunflowers? Peppers?), but they originate from the Americas. The book is from 1404 (Pre-Columbus). Impossible. Unless the date is wrong, or Vikings brought seeds?

## Introduction: 9500 BC
Stonehenge was built in 3000 BC.
Pyramids in 2500 BC.
Gobekli Tepe (Turkey) was built in **9500 BC**.
That is 7,000 years older than the Pyramids.
It was built *before* pottery. *Before* farming. *Before* the wheel.
By cavemen.

## 1. The Structure
Huge T-Shaped limestone pillars. 20 tons each.
Carved with 3D reliefs of lions, scorpions, vultures.
You need 500 men to move these stones.
You need to feed them.
Hunter-gatherers can't feed 500 men.
So they *invented* farming to feed the temple builders.
**Religion birthed Civilization.** (Not the other way around).

## 2. The Burial
Around 8000 BC, they deliberately buried the temple.
They filled it with sand.
Why?
To protect it? Or to banish the old gods?
Because they buried it, it is perfectly preserved.

## 3. The Skull Cult
Fragments of skulls were found.
They were carved and drilled.
Likely they hung the skulls of ancestors (or enemies) on the pillars.
It helps us rewrite the history of humanity. We were sophisticated engineers long before we were farmers.

### Fact Box
*   **Beer:** Some archaeologists think they invented agriculture not for bread, but for **Beer**. Large vats were found at the site. A massive neolithic party to celebrate the gods.
