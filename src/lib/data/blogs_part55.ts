## Introduction: The Pride of the Fleet
The **Kursk (K-141)** was a monster.
It was twice the size of a Jumbo Jet (154 meters).
It could survive a direct Nuclear hit.
It carried 24 Granit missiles (Ship Killers).
August 2000. It was practicing in the Barents Sea.
A faulty torpedo exploded in the tube.

## 1. The HTP Explosion
The torpedo used **High Test Peroxide (HTP)** as fuel.
HTP is unstable. If it touches rust or copper, it expands 5000x instantly into superheated steam.
A bad weld leaked HTP.
**BANG.**
The first explosion killed the torpedo room crew.
The submarine dived into the sea floor.
The fire ranged.
2 minutes later... the heat cooked the other warheads.
**BANG (Part 2).**
The second explosion was 7 tons of TNT. It registered as an earthquake across Europe.
It ripped the nose of the sub off.

## 2. The Survivors (Compartment 9)
The reactor scrammed (Shutdown) automatically.
The back of the sub survived.
23 men led by Lt. Captain Dmitri Kolesnikov gathered in Compartment 9 (Escape Hatch).
The power was out. It was pitch black. Freezing. Water rising.
Kolesnikov wrote a note in the dark:
"13:15. All personnel from compartments 6, 7, and 8 moved to the 9th. There are 23 of us here. We feel bad. None of us can get to the surface."
They waited for a rescue that never came.
They tapped SOS on the hull with a hammer. Clang... Clang...
Russian sonar heard it.

## 3. The Politics of Pride
Putin (new President) didn't want Western help.
The Russian rescue mini-sub (Priz) was old and broken. Its battery failed. It couldn't dock.
The British and Norwegians offered superior subs.
Russia refused for 5 days. ("Protecting State Secrets").
When they finally let the Norwegian divers down... they opened the hatch in minutes.
It was flooded.
All 118 men were dead.
**Cause of Death:**
Not drowning. **Oxygen Candle Fire.**
They tried to light a chemical candle to generate oxygen. It fell into the oily water. Flash fire. It burned all the oxygen in seconds.
Suffocation.
It was a tragedy of secrecy over survival.

### Fact Box
*   **The Widow:** At a press conference, Nadia Tylik (mother of a sailor) screamed at the Generals. A nurse walked up behind her and injected her with a sedative to shut her up. It was caught on CNN. It showed the world how Russia deals with dissent.

## Introduction: Breakbulk
Before 1956, shipping was "Breakbulk".
Men carried sacks of coffee and crates of bananas manually into the hull.
It was tetris. It took 20 men 7 days to load a ship.
Theft was rampant. (Whiskey bottles usually arrived empty).
Cost: $5.83 per ton.

## 1. Malcolm McLean
He was a trucker. He hated waiting at the port.
Idea: "Why not just lift the whole truck trailer onto the ship?"
He bought an old tanker (Ideal X).
He stacked 58 metal boxes on it.
**The Revolution:**
Cost dropped to **$0.16 per ton**.
Speed went from days to hours.
You could lock the box at the factory in China and unlock it at the store in Kansas. No theft.

## 2. Standardization (TEU)
It only works if *every* box fits *every* truck and *every* crane worldwide.
The ISO standard "Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit" (TEU).
Result:
Ships got huge. (Ever Given carries 20,000 TEU).
Ports became automated robotic zones.
The Longshoremen Unions (tens of thousands of jobs) were decimated.
The price of foreign goods crashed.
Shipping a TV from China to LA now costs $2. (Less than the postage to mail a letter across town).

## 3. Flags of Convenience
Look at a ship. It's probably flying a Panama, Liberia, or Marshall Islands flag.
Why?
**Taxes and Regulations.**
US labor laws require safe wages and conditions.
Liberia? Not so much.
Ship owners register the ship in a tax haven to hire cheap crews (Filipinos/Indians) and pay zero tax.
It is a regulatory "Race to the Bottom".
90% of global trade floats on this loophole.

### Fact Box
*   **Lost at Sea:** About 1,500 containers fall off ships every year during storms. They float just below the surface ("Growlers"), sinking private yachts who hit them. Some are full of Nike shoes. One fell off in 1992 full of rubber ducks. They are still washing up today, mapping ocean currents.

## Introduction: The Shortcut
To go from NY to San Francisco, you had to sail around South America (Cape Horn).
13,000 miles. Dangerous storms.
A canal through Panama cuts it to 5,000 miles.

## 1. The French Failure (De Lesseps)
Ferdinand de Lesseps built the Suez Canal (sand).
He went to Panama (jungle/mountains).
He tried to dig a Sea Level Canal (no locks).
**Mistake:** The mountains kept sliding into the ditch.
**The Killer:** Yellow Fever and Malaria.
22,000 workers died.
France went bankrupt.

## 2. The American Success (Teddy Roosevelt)
TR took over in 1904.
He sent **Dr. William Gorgas**.
Gorgas realized mosquitoes carried the disease.
He drained the swamps. He fumigated every house. He put oil on every puddle.
Yellow Fever was eradicated.
**The Lock System:**
Chief Engineer John Stevens said: "Don't dig through the mountain. Go *over* it."
They dammed the Chagres River to create a massive artificial lake (Gatun Lake) 85ft above sea level.
**How it works:**
1.  Ship enters Lock.
2.  Water feeds in by gravity (no pumps).
3.  Ship rises 28ft.
4.  Repeat 3 times -> Enter Lake.
5.  Sail across Lake.
6.  Lock down on the other side.
It is a water elevator.

## 3. The Expansion
In 2016, they widened it ("Neo-Panamax").
Ships are getting too big.
**The Drought:**
Climate Change is drying up Gatun Lake.
The Canal runs on fresh water (millions of gallons flushed to sea per ship).
If it doesn't rain, ships can't cross.
In 2024, traffic was slashed by 40%. The lifeline of trade is thirsty.

### Fact Box
*   **The Price:** A cruise ship pays ~$400,000 to cross. The cheapest toll ever? Richard Halliburton swam the canal in 1928. He paid 36 cents (based on his weight).

## Introduction: The Myth
Mathematical models said: "Waves follow a Gaussian curve."
A 30-meter wave happens once every 10,000 years.
Sailors said: "No, I saw one last Tuesday."
Ships vanish constantly without SOS.
We assumed bad maintenance.
We were wrong.

## 1. The Draupner Wave (1995)
New Year's Day. North Sea.
A laser sensor on an oil rig measured a wave.
**25.6 meters (84 ft).**
This was impossible by the Standard Model.
It was real.
The "Rogue Wave" was proved.
It is defined as height > 2x Significant Wave Height.

## 2. Constructive Interference
How do they form?
1.  **Linear Superposition:** Two wave trains cross. The peaks align. 1+1 = 2.
2.  **Non-Linear Focusing (Schrodinger Equation):**
In deep water, waves can "steal" energy from their neighbors.
A big wave sucks the energy from the small waves around it, growing exponentially for a few minutes before collapsing.
It is an energy vampire.
**The Agulhas Current:**
Off South Africa, fast current runs *against* the waves.
This shortens the wavelength and stacks them up.
It is a ship graveyard.

## 3. Can ships survive?
No.
Ships are designed to bend over long swells (Hogging/Sagging).
A Rogue Wave is a vertical wall of concrete.
If a 1000ft ship hits a 100ft wave...
The bow floats up. The stern floats up (on the next wave).
The middle hangs in mid-air.
**SNAP.**
The keel breaks. The ship folds in half.
(München 1978 vanished instantly. We think this happened).

### Fact Box
*   **The Poseidon Adventure:** The movie where a wave flips a cruise ship? Unlikely. But a rogue wave *did* hit the Queen Elizabeth 2. The captain said "It looked like the White Cliffs of Dover coming at us." It smashed the bridge windows 90ft up.

        description: "It wasn't just the iceberg. It was the rivets. It was the mirage. It was the rudder. The perfect storm of failure.",
        category: "Maritime",

## Introduction: Unsinkable?
The Titanic had 16 watertight compartments.
She could float with 4 flooded.
She flooded 5.
Why? The iceberg scraped along the side, opening a long seam like a zipper.

## 1. The Rivets (Metallurgy)
We recovered rivets from the wreck.
**Slag Inclusions:** The iron was dirty. It contained too much slag (glassy residue).
In the freezing water (-2°C), the metal became **Brittle**.
When the collision happened, the rivets didn't stretch (deform). They popped the heads off like buttons on a tight shirt.
The plates opened up.
If they had used high-grade steel rivets, she might have bounced off.

## 2. The Rudder
The Titanic had a small rudder for her size.
Why? Design laws from 1800s.
Also, the center propeller couldn't reverse.
When Murdoch shouted "Hard a-starboard, Full Astern!"...
Reversing the engines reduced the water flow over the rudder.
It made the turn slower.
If he had kept "Full Ahead" and turned... she might have cleared it.
(Or if he hit it head-on... the crumple zone would have saved the ship).

## 3. The Cold Water Mirage
Why didn't they see the iceberg?
It was a moonless night. Calm sea (no waves breaking on the berg).
**Thermal Inversion.**
Cold air bent the light (Mirage).
It created a false horizon that hid the iceberg until it was too late.
The same mirage made the Titanic look like a blur to the **Californian** (the ship 10 miles away that didn't help). They didn't recognize her distress rockets as signals.

### Fact Box
*   **The Coal Fire:** A fire was burning in Coal Bunker 6 for *weeks* before departure. It weakened the bulkhead steel. Guess where the iceberg hit? Right at Bunker 6. The weakened wall failed faster.
