## Introduction: The Wall of Men
Sparta had no city walls. They said: "Our men are our walls."
At age 7, boys were taken from their mothers.
They entered the **Agoge**.

## 1. The Training
It wasn't school. It was survival.
They were starved to encourage stealing (Stealth).
If caught, they were whipped... for getting caught, not for stealing.
They slept on reeds. They wore one cloak all year.
At 18, they graduated by joining the Cryptia (Secret Police) to hunt Helots (Slaves).

The 300 Spartans at Thermopylae is legendary.
They held off 150,000 Persians for 3 days.

## Introduction: Engineering War
Barbarians fought as a mob. Romans fought as a machine.
A **Legion** (5,000 men) was a self-contained city.
They could march 20 miles a day, build a fortified camp every night, and build bridges over the Rhine in a week.

## 1. The Gladius
They didn't use long swords. They used the **Gladius** (Short sword).
They fought shoulder-to-shoulder behind large shields (Scutum).
Stab, step. Stab, step.
It was a meat grinder.
The **Testudo** (Tortoise) formation made them immune to arrows.

## 2. Decimation
Discipline was absolute.
If a unit was cowardly, they faced **Decimation** (Removal of a Tenth).
1 in 10 men were chosen by lot and beaten to death by their comrades.
It terrified them more than the enemy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Roman Legion** was the elite military unit of ancient Rome. Its success relied on heavy discipline, standardized equipment (Gladius/Pilum), and engineering prowess. Unlike tribal armies, Legionaries were professional career soldiers who could construct roads and forts as effectively as they fought battles.

## Introduction: Achaemenid Power
The Persian Empire was massive.
Their elite unit was always kept at exactly 10,000 men.
If a man fell sick or died, a reserve stepped in.
To the enemy, it looked like they never died. They were a faceless endless wave.

## 1. Equipment
They weren't heavy tanks like Spartans.
They were light, fast, and versatile.
They carried bows, spears, and daggers.
They wore scale armor under colorful robes.
They were the best archers in the world.

## 2. The Fall
At Thermopylae, they struggled against the heavy Spartan shields.
But in open terrain, their speed and arrows were deadly.
Alexander the Great finally defeated them, but he respected them so much he kept them as his own guard.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Immortals** were the elite heavy infantry unit of the Achaemenid Empire (First Persian Empire). Herodotus described them as being kept constantly at a strength of exactly 10,000 men. They served as both the Imperial Guard and the standing army, known for the psychological warfare of their apparent "invincibility."

## Introduction: The Blitzkrieg
The Mongols invented Blitzkrieg (Lightning War).
Every soldier had 3-4 horses.
They could travel 100 miles a day.
Armies would wake up to find Mongols *behind* them.

## 1. The Bow
The **Composite Bow** (Horn, Wood, Sinew) was the sniper rifle of the middle ages.
They could shoot accurately while riding at full gallop.
They used the "Feigned Retreat". They pretended to run away.
The enemy would break formation to chase them.
Then the Mongols would turn around (Parthian Shot) and slaughter them.

## 2. Terror
Genghis Khan gave cities a choice.
Surrender -> Pay Tax -> Live.
Resist -> Everyone dies.
He killed millions (reducing global CO2 levels).
Most cities surrendered without a fight.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Mongol Army** conquered the largest contiguous land empire in history. Their dominance was due to the **Horse Archer**, who combined mobility with firepower. Their strategic use of the feigned retreat and psychological terror allowed them to defeat heavily armored European knights and Chinese armies alike.

## Introduction: Solider Priests
A Monk prays. A Knight kills.
The Templars did both.
They swore vows of poverty and chastity, but they trained to kill for God.
They protected pilgrims going to Jerusalem.

## 1. The Bank
Pilgrims didn't want to carry gold (Robbers).
So the Templars invented the **Check**.
You deposit gold in London. They give you a coded paper.
You cash it in Jerusalem.
This made the Order incredibly rich. They owned fleets of ships and castles.
They lent money to Kings.

## 2. Friday the 13th
King Philip IV of France owed them too much money.
So he decided to cancel the debt... by killing them.
On Friday the 13th (October 1307), he arrested them all.
He accused them of spitting on the cross and devil worship (Baphomet).
He burned them at the stake.
The Order dissolved, but the banking system remained.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Knights Templar** were a Catholic military order founded in 1119. Famed for their discipline in battle during the Crusades, they also established an early form of modern **Banking** to protect pilgrims' funds. Their massive wealth and power led to their downfall when King Philip IV of France disbanded the order and executed its leaders to erase his debts.
