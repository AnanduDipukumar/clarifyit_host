## Introduction: Counting Ghosts
The Sun burns via Nuclear Fusion.
The math says it should produce X number of **Neutrinos**.
We built a giant detector in a mine (Homestake Experiment) to count them.
We only found 1/3 of them.
Panic.
Is our model of the Sun wrong? Is the Sun dying?

## 1. The Chameleon Particle
Neutrinos come in 3 flavors: Electron, Muon, Tau.
The Sun produces Electron Neutrinos.
Our detector could *only* see Electron Neutrinos.
The solution: On their way to Earth, the neutrinos **Oscillate** (change flavor).
They turn into Muon/Tau neutrinos, which were invisible to us.

## 2. Mass
This proved that **Neutrinos have Mass**.
(Only things with mass can experience time to change).
It broke the Standard Model (which said they were massless).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Solar Neutrino Problem** was a major discrepancy between the predicted and observed number of neutrinos coming from the Sun. It was solved by the discovery of **Neutrino Oscillation**, proving that neutrinos can change between their three types (flavors) during flight, which implies they possess non-zero mass.

## Introduction: The Asymmetry
Electricity has Positive (+) and Negative (-) charges. You can have just a (+) Proton.
Magnetism has North and South poles.
But you can NEVER have just a North pole.
Maxwell's Equations say $\\nabla \\cdot B = 0$ (No Monopoles).

## 1. Dirac's Dream
Paul Dirac proved that if *just one* Magnetic Monopole exists in the entire universe, it explains why Electric Charge is quantized (why electrons have exactly -1 charge).
It is too elegant to be wrong.
String Theory also predicts them.
Cosmic Inflation says they should have been created in the Big Bang.

## 2. Where are they?
We have never found one.
Maybe Inflation spread them out so much that there is only 1 in our galaxy.
Experiments like MoEDAL at CERN are still looking.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Magnetic Monopole** is a hypothetical particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice versa). While their existence is predicted by Grand Unified Theories to explain charge quantization, none have ever been observed.

## Introduction: Stability
We think the Proton is stable.
We have never seen one die.
But Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) say they *must* decay eventually.
The half-life is estimated at $10^{34}$ years.

## 1. Super-Kamiokande
We built a giant tank of pure water in Japan (50,000 tons).
It contains billions of protons.
If one decays, it will emit a flash of light.
We have watched it for years.
Nothing.
If protons don't decay, we exist forever.
If they do, matter is temporary.

## 2. The End
If they decay, the final state of the universe is just photons and black holes (which also evaporate).
Complete emptiness.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Proton Decay** is a hypothetical form of particle decay where the proton decays into lighter subatomic particles, such as a pion and a positron. If it occurs, it implies that all baryonic matter (stars, planets, us) is temporary and will eventually disintegrate, leaving a universe of only radiation.

## Introduction: Force Carriers
In Quantum Mechanics, forces are carried by particles.
EM Force -> Photon.
Strong Force -> Gluon.
Weak Force -> W/Z Bosons.
Gravity -> **Graviton**.

## 1. The Spin
Theory says the Graviton must be massless and have a "Spin" of 2.
But we can't find it.
Gravity is $10^{40}$ times weaker than electromagnetism.
Detecting a single Graviton is arguably impossible with current tech.
You would need a detector the size of Jupiter.

## 2. String Theory
In String Theory, the Graviton is a closed loop string (a circle).
This allows it to float *between* dimensions.
This might be why gravity is so weak—it is leaking into other universes.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Graviton** is the hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the force of gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory. Unlike other force carriers (Photons, Gluons), it has not been detected, and reconciling it with General Relativity remains the biggest challenge in physics (Quantum Gravity).

## Introduction: The Wobble
The Muon is a heavy electron.
It acts like a tiny magnet.
If you put it in a magnetic field, it spins (wobbles).
The Standard Model predicts the *exact* speed of the wobble (g-factor).
Precision: 0.000000001%.

## 1. The Experiment
Fermilab measured it.
The Muon is wobbling *too fast*.
The difference is tiny (4.2 sigma), but it shouldn't be there.
It suggests something is pushing it.
A ghost particle? Dark Matter? A Fifth Force?

## 2. The Crisis
This is the most exciting thing in physics right now.
It means the Standard Model is broken.
There is something else out there.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Muon g-2** experiment measures the magnetic moment of the muon. Recent results show a discrepancy between the experimental value and the Standard Model prediction. This anomaly suggests the existence of undiscovered particles or forces interacting with the muon, potentially opening the door to **New Physics**.
