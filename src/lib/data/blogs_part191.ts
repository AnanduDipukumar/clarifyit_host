## Introduction: Dirt is Order
Mary Douglas (*Purity and Danger*) argued that "Dirt" is not about hygiene.
It is about **Order**.
"Dirt is matter out of place."
Shoes on the floor = Clean.
Shoes on the table = Dirty.
Food on the plate = Clean.
Food on your shirt = Dirty.
Society creates categories (The Sacred and The Profane). Anything that crosses the line is **Taboo**.

## 1. The Abomination
In the Bible (Leviticus), why is Pork forbidden?
Douglas argues it's not because pigs are dirty.
It's because they defy classification.
Rules: "Animals that chew the cud AND have cloven hooves are clean."
Cows do both (Clean).
Pigs have cloven hooves but do NOT chew cud.
They are a glitch in the matrix. They are "Abominations" because they break the rule.
Sea creatures must have fins and scales.
Lobsters have neither (Abomination).

## 2. Pollution
When you break a Taboo (Incest, Cannibalism), you are "Polluted".
You endanger the whole tribe.
Rituals (Washing, Confession) are designed to restore the boundaries.
Taboos hold society together by defining what we are *not*.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Taboo** is a social or religious custom prohibiting or forbidding discussion of a particular practice or association with a particular person, place, or thing. Anthropologist **Mary Douglas** theorized that taboos exist to protect society's conceptual systems. Things that are ambiguous or "out of place" are viewed as dangerous pollution that must be contained.

## Introduction: The Original Religion
Before Zeus, before Yahweh, before Buddha... there was **Animism**.
The belief that *everything* has a spirit (Anima).
You don't just chop down a tree. You ask the Tree Spirit for permission.
You don't just drink from a river. You thank the River Spirit.
It wasn't worship. It was diplomacy.
You lived in a world full of Persons, not Things.

## 1. The Disenchantment
Max Weber called modernity "The Disenchantment of the World".
Science killed the spirits.
A tree became "Lumber". A river became "H2O".
We treat the world as dead matter to be exploited.
Animists treated the world as a kin to be respected.
Ecologists are now realizing that the Animist view ("Everything is connected") was scientifically more accurate than the Industrial view.

## 2. Panpsychism
Today, philosophers are revisiting this as **Panpsychism**.
The idea that Consciousness is a fundamental property of matter, like Mass or Charge.
If an electron has a tiny spark of experience... then a rock (trillions of electrons) might have a slow, deep hum of being.
Maybe the ancients weren't metaphoric.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Animism** is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. It perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork, and perhaps even words—as animated and alive. It forms the basis of Shamanism and Indigenous belief systems globally.

## Introduction: I am Richer than You
The Kwakwaka'wakw people had a strange way of showing status.
They held a **Potlatch**.
The Chief would invite his rival.
He would give away everything he owned.
Thousands of blankets, canoes, slaves, and food.
Sometimes, he would even *burn* his wealth in a fire just to show he could afford to waste it.
The message: "I am so powerful, this wealth means nothing to me."

## 1. The Gift Trap
The guest was now in debt.
He was shamed.
To regain his honor, he had to hold a *bigger* Potlatch and give away *more*.
It was an economic arms race.
But unlike Capitalism (Accumulation), this was a **Gift Economy** (Circulation).
Wealth only had value when it moved. Receiving was shameful; giving was glorious.

## 2. The Ban
The Canadian Government banned the Potlatch in 1884.
They thought it was "Irrational" and "Wasteful".
They wanted the natives to save money and be good Capitalists.
But the Potlatch was the glue of their society. It redistributed food to the poor and solidified alliances.
Without it, the social structure collapsed.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Potlatch** is a gift-giving feast practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. It serves as the primary economic system, where status is determined not by who has the most, but by who distributes the most. It prevents wealth hoarding and creates a web of social debt that binds the community together.

## Introduction: The Threshold
In the Maasai tribe, a boy must hunt a lion (historically) or endure circumcision without flinching to become a Warrior.
In Judaism, the Bar Mitzvah.
In Vanuatu, the Land Diving (Bungee jumping with vines).
Arnold van Gennep identified the structure of all **Rites of Passage**.

## 1. The Three Stages
1.  **Separation:** You are removed from society (Taken to the woods). You are stripped of your old identity.
2.  **Liminality (The Threshold):** You are in the "In-Between". You are neither child nor adult. You undergo trials. Meaning is fluid.
3.  **Re-Incorporation:** You return to society with a new status (Man/Woman).

## 2. The Modern Void
We have lost our Rites of Passage.
When does a boy become a man in America?
When he can drink? When he loses his virginity? When he pays taxes?
It is unclear.
Joseph Campbell argued that this lack of initiation leads to "Peter Pan Syndrome".
Without a ritual to mark the death of childhood, we remain children forever.
Gangs often fill this void with violent initiations because society provides none.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Rite of Passage** is a ceremony or event marking an important stage in someone's life, especially birth, puberty, marriage, and death. These rituals guide individuals through social transitions, providing a clear psychological boundary between "The Old Self" and "The New Self."

## Introduction: No Man's Land
**Liminal** comes from the Latin *Limen* (Threshold).
It is the state of being on the doorway.
You have left the room, but haven't entered the next one.
Victor Turner described it as "Betwixt and Between."
In this state, normal rules don't apply.
Hierarchy dissolves. Time feels weird.

## 1. Liminal Spaces
Physical places can be liminal.
*   **Airports:** You aren't in a city. You are in transit. You eat McDonalds at 6 AM. You sleep on the floor. It is a suspension of reality.
*   **Empty Schools at Night:** They are designed for people. Without people, they feel "Wrong".
*   **Twilight:** Not day, not night. The magic hour. Most folklore monsters appear in liminal times.

## 2. Communitas
Liminality is scary, but powerful.
People going through a transition together form a deep bond called **Communitas**.
Soldiers in boot camp. Freshmen during orientation. Disaster survivors.
They are stripped of status (Rich/Poor doesn't matter). They are just "Humans in the struggle".
It is the purest form of society.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Liminality** is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. It represents pure possibility and chaos, outside the structures of normal social order.
