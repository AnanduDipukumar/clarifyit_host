## Introduction: Rotting Alive
Scurvy is terrifying.
Your gums rot. Your teeth fall out. Old wounds *re-open*.
(If you had a cut 20 years ago that healed, the scar tissue dissolves and it bleeds again).
It killed 2 million sailors between 1500 and 1800.
Vasco da Gama lost 100 of his 160 men to it.

## 1. The Cure (Lost and Found)
James Lind (1747) ran the first clinical trial in history.
He gave sailors Vinegar, Seawater, Cider, or **Oranges/Lemons**.
The Lemon group recovered purely.
Case closed?
No.
The British Navy decided to use **Limes** instead (cheaper, from colonies).
Limes have 4x less Vitamin C than Lemons.
They processed the juice in copper vats (which destroys Vitamin C).
So the "Cure" stopped working.
Experts decided Scurvy was caused by "Tainted Meat" or "Laziness". It took another 50 years to figure it out.

> **Mental Model: Collagen Glue**
> Why do old wounds open?
> Vitamin C is required to build **Collagen**.
> Collagen is the glue that holds your cells together.
> Without Vitamin C, your body un-glues. You literally fall apart.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Scurvy** is a disease caused by **Vitamin C deficiency**. It prevents the synthesis of collagen, leading to tissue breakdown. Despite James Lind proving that citrus fruit cured it in 1747, logistical errors (switching to limes) and bad science delayed the eradication of the disease for nearly a century.

## Introduction: The Summer Terror
In the 1950s, parents wouldn't let kids swim in pools.
Polio was the boogeyman. It paralyzed children randomly.
Iron Lungs lined hospital wards.
Jonas Salk developed a vaccine using **Dead Virus**.
Albert Sabin developed a vaccine using **Live (Weakened) Virus**.
The race was on.

## 1. The Cutter Incident
Salk won. In 1955, the vaccine was declared safe.
Mass production began.
Cutter Laboratories (a manufacturer) screwed up.
They failed to kill the virus in their batch.
They injected live, weaponized polio into 200,000 children.
40,000 got sick. 200 were paralyzed. 10 died.
It was the worst pharmaceutical disaster in US history.
It almost killed the anti-polio movement.

## 2. The Liability Legacy
Because of the Cutter Incident, pharmaceutical companies stopped making vaccines. (Too much liability).
The US Government had to create a "Vaccine Court" (VICP) to shield companies from lawsuits, otherwise, nobody would make vaccines at all.
We eradicated Polio, but the legal scars remain.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Patent Free:**
> Jonas Salk famously did not patent the vaccine.
> "Could you patent the sun?"
> He lost out on ~$7 Billion.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Polio** (Poliomyelitis) is a viral disease that attacks the nervous system. The creation of the vaccine by **Jonas Salk** (Inactivated) and **Albert Sabin** (Oral Attenuated) led to its near-global eradication. However, the manufacturing failure by Cutter Labs in 1955 serves as a grim reminder of the importance of quality control in mass medicine.

## Introduction: The Stress Myth
For decades, if you had a stomach ulcer, doctors told you:
"Stop stressing. Eat bland food."
They prescribed antacids and surgery.
Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (Australia, 1980s) noticed a bacteria in the stomachs of ulcer patients.
**Helicobacter pylori.**
The medical establishment laughed. "The stomach is too acidic. Bacteria can't live there."

## 1. The Self-Experiment
Marshall couldn't test on mice (they don't get H. Pylori).
He couldn't test on humans (unethical).
So he took a beaker of *H. Pylori* broth... and drank it.
Days later, he was vomiting.
He gave himself gastritis.
Then he took **Antibiotics**.
He cured himself.

## 2. The Impact
He proved Ulcers are an **Infection**, not a lifestyle condition.
The cure wasn't "Calm Down", it was a $10 pack of antibiotics.
It revolutionized gastroenterology.
He won the Nobel Prize in 2005.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **H. Pylori** is a bacterium that burrows into the stomach lining, protecting itself from acid by secreting ammonia. It is the primary cause of **Gastric Ulcers** and Stomach Cancer. Barry Marshall's courageous self-experiment proved that ulcers are an infectious disease treatable with antibiotics, overturning the dogma that they were caused by stress.

## Introduction: The Age of Earth
Clair Patterson (1950s) was trying to date the Earth using Uranium-Lead decay in meteorites.
His samples were always contaminated.
There was too much Lead in the lab.
He built the first "Clean Room".
He realized the lead wasn't just in his lab. It was everywhere.
In the air. In the water. In the snow.

## 1. TEL (Tetraethyl Lead)
GM and Standard Oil put Lead in gasoline to stop engine knocking.
They knew it was toxic. The workers went insane ("The House of Butterflies").
But it was profitable.
Patterson proved that atmospheric lead levels had skyrocketed heavily since 1923.
We were breathing poison.
Lead lowers IQ and causes aggression (Crime).

## 2. The Fight
The Oil Industry tried to fire him. They defunded his research.
He persisted.
In the 1970s, the US passed the Clean Air Act and banned Leaded Gas.
Global Lead levels in blood dropped by 80%.
Violent crime dropped by 50% (The Lead-Crime Hypothesis).
Clair Patterson saved our brains.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Lead Poisoning** is a neurotoxin that accumulates in the body/bones. In the 20th Century, the use of **Leaded Gasoline** caused worldwide contamination. Clair Patterson, while determining the age of the Earth (4.55 Billion Years), discovered this contamination and campaigned to ban lead additives, arguably saving the collective IQ of humanity.

## Introduction: The Speckled Monster
Smallpox was the grim reaper. 30% fatality rate. Survivors were blind or scarred.
Edward Jenner (1796) heard a rumor.
Milkmaids who caught **Cowpox** (mild spots on hands) never caught Smallpox.
Did the cow disease protect them?

## 1. The Experiment
Jenner took pus from a Cowpox blister (on the hand of milkmaid Sarah Nelmes).
He scratched it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy, James Phipps.
The boy got a fever, then recovered.
Then Jenner did the unthinkable.
He injected the boy with **Smallpox**.
The boy survived. He was immune.
**Vaccination** (Vacca = Cow) was born.

## 2. Eradication
In 1979, the WHO declared Smallpox **Eradicated**.
It is the only human disease we have successfully wiped off the face of the Earth.
It exists now only in two freezers (CDC in Atlanta, Vector in Russia).
Aliens landing today would think humans are gods for this achievement alone.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Variolation:**
> Before vaccines, people used "Variolation". They would blow dried smallpox scabs up your nose.
> It gave you a mild case (1% death rate) to prevent the severe case (30% death rate).
> It worked, but it was risky.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Smallpox** was the deadliest disease in human history. Edward Jenner's discovery that exposure to the milder **Cowpox** virus conferred immunity led to the first vaccine. Through a global coordinated effort, it became the first (and only) disease to be completely eradicated from the wild.
