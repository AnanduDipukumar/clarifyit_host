## Introduction: The Radical Cure
In the 1960s, doctors had a drastic cure for severe epilepsy.
If a seizure starts in the Left brain, it travels across the bridge (Corpus Callosum) to the Right brain, creating a "Grand Mal" seizure (whole body convulsion).
Solution: **Callosotomy**. Slice the bridge in half.
It worked. Seizures stopped.
Patients seemed normal. They walked, talked, and joked.
But Roger Sperry (Nobel Prize) looked closer.
He found two people living in one skull.

## 1. The Experiment
**Left Brain:** Controls Right hand. Has Language (Broca's Area). Speaks.
**Right Brain:** Controls Left hand. Has No Language. Visual/Spatial. Mute.
**The Test:**
Flash a picture of a **Spoon** to the Left Eye only (goes to Right Brain).
Ask patient: "What did you see?"
Patient: "Nothing." (Because the Left Brain - the one that talks - saw nothing).
Ask patient: "Pick up the object with your Left hand."
The Left Hand picks up the Spoon.
The Patient is confused: "Why is my hand holding a spoon?"
**The Interpreter:**
The Left Brain (The Narrator) immediately confabulates a lie: "Oh, I must be hungry."
It invents a reason for an action it didn't command.

## 2. Alien Hand Syndrome
In some cases, the split is violent.
A patient tries to light a cigarette with his Right hand. His Left hand slaps it away and throws it down.
A patient tries to hug his wife with his Right arm. His Left arm punches her.
The Right Hemisphere (Silent) has different morals/desires than the Left Hemisphere (Talking).
It raises the question:: **Are there two souls?**
If you believe in an afterlife, which one goes? The one that believes in God, or the atheist one?

## 3. The Illusion of Unity
You feel like "One Self".
But you are likely a committee.
The Corpus Callosum sends 200 million messages a second to keep the stories synchronized.
Sever that wire, and the illusion collapses.
We are all just a collection of specialized modules (Face recognition, Language, Fear) that vote on what to do. The "Self" is just the Spokesperson.

### Fact Box
*   **The Wada Test:** To find out which side of your brain handles language before surgery, doctors inject anesthetic into one carotid artery. It puts *half* your brain to sleep. If they numb the Left side and you stop counting out loud, your language is Left-dominant (like 95% of people).

## Introduction: The vulnerability
Sleeping is dangerous. You are unconscious for 8 hours. A tiger can eat you.
Evolution is ruthless. If sleep wasn't *absolutely necessary*, we would have evolved it away millions of years ago.
So what is it for?
Memory consolidation? Yes.
Recharging energy? Maybe.
In 2012, we found the real reason: **Plumbing.**

## 1. The Glymphatic System
The body has a Lymphatic system to drain waste.
The Brain does not. It is locked behind the Blood-Brain Barrier.
How does it poop?
Maiken Nedergaard discovered that during **Deep Sleep (NREM 3)**, the brain cells physically **shrink by 60%**.
This opens up channels between the neurons.
The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) rushes in like a tidal wave.
It washes away the metabolic waste (Beta-Amyloid, Tau proteins) generated during the day.
It is a dishwasher cycle.
**Alzheimer's Link:**
Beta-Amyloid is the gunk that causes Alzheimer's.
If you sleep 4 hours/night, you aren't washing the dishes. The gunk builds up.
Chronic sleep deprivation is a direct cause of dementia.

## 2. REM (Rapid Eye Movement)
After the wash (Deep Sleep), comes the Movie (REM).
The brain is *more* active in REM than when awake.
It paralyzes your muscles (Atonia) so you don't act out your dreams.
**The Function:**
Emotional Processing.
The brain replays the day's memories but *strips away the painful emotion* (Noradrenaline is shut off).
It turns "Trauma" into "Memory".
PTSD patients have broken REM sleep. They relive the trauma without stripping the emotion.

## 3. The Adenosine Clock
Why do you get tired?
Active neurons burn ATP. The byproduct is **Adenosine**.
Adenosine floats around and docks onto receptors, telling the brain "Slow down".
**Caffeine:**
Caffeine looks like Adenosine.
It jams the receptor.
It doesn't give you energy. It just blocks the "I'm Tired" signal.
The Adenosine keeps building up. When the caffeine wears off -> **Crash**.

### Fact Box
*   **Dolphins:** Dolphins sleep with half a brain at a time. Left side sleeps, Right side swims/breathes. Then they switch. They can never stop moving.

## Introduction: The Old Dogma
Until 1990, scientists thought: "The brain stops growing at age 25. Then you just lose neurons until you die."
Wrong.
The Brain changes shape every day.
**"Neurons that fire together, wire together."** (Hebb's Law).

## 1. The Mechanism: LTP
Long Term Potentiation.
A sends a signal to B.
If A simulates B repeatedly and strongly, the synapse (connection) grows physically bigger.
More receptors are added.
The "Road" becomes a "Highway".
This is **Learning**.
**Pruning:**
If you stop playing piano, the road degrades. The brain scavenges the resources for something else.
"Use it or lose it."

## 2. Sensory Substitution
Paul Bach-y-Rita invented a chair for blind people.
It had a camera. The camera sent signals to a grid of vibrators on the user's back.
At first, they felt buzzing.
After a week, they "Saw".
The visual cortex (V1) - having no input from eyes - started processing the tactile input from the back.
The brain doesn't care where the data comes from. It just finds patterns.
Blind people can "Echolocate" (Clicking). FMRI shows their Visual Cortex lights up when they listen to echoes. They are literally seeing with sound.

## 3. Phantoms
Amputate an arm.
The "Arm Map" in the brain is arguably still there.
The "Face Map" is right next to it.
Because the Arm Map is hungry for input but gets none, the Face Map invades.
If you touch the amputee's cheek, they feel it on their missing thumb.
**Phantom Pain:**
The brain thinks the missing arm is clenched in a fist. It hurts.
**Mirror Box Therapy (Ramachandran):**
Use a mirror to trick the brain into seeing the "Good" arm as the "Missing" arm.
Unclench the good hand. The brain sees the motion.
It relaxes the phantom fist. Pain vanishes.
You hacked the brain with a mirror.

### Fact Box
*   **Taxi Drivers:** London Cabbies have to memorize 25,000 streets (The Knowledge). MRI scans show their **Hippocampus** (Navigation center) is physically larger than average humans. The brain grew muscle to fit the map.

## Introduction: The Surgery
1953. Henry Molaison (H.M.) had epilepsy.
Doctors scooped out his **Hippocampus** on both sides.
Seizures stopped.
But Henry stopped making new memories.
You could introduce yourself, leave the room, come back 1 minute later, and he would greet you as a stranger.
He remembered his childhood (Pre-1953). He remembered how to talk.
But he could not convert **Short Term** to **Long Term**.

## 1. Procedural Memory (The Star)
Brenda Milner asked H.M. to trace a star while looking in a mirror (hard).
Day 1: He sucked.
Day 2: He was better.
Day 3: He was perfect.
But on Day 3, he said: "I have never done this staring test before."
**Discovery:**
Muscle Memory (Procedural) is stored in the **Cerebellum/Basal Ganglia**.
Facts/Events (Declarative) are stored in the **Hippocampus**.
They are different hard drives.
This is why an Alzheimer's patient can still play the piano beautifully but not know their own name.

## 2. Memory is Reconstruction
We think memory is a video file.
It's not. It's a storytelling algorithm.
Every time you *access* a memory, you take it off the shelf, look at it, and *rewrite it*.
You add details that weren't there. You change the color of the car.
The memory becomes less accurate the more you remember it.
**Eyewitness Testimony:**
It is notoriously unreliable.
It is easy to implant false memories ("Did you see the blue car?" "Yes." - There was no blue car).

## 3. The Grandmother Neuron
Do you have a single neuron that only fires for Jennifer Aniston?
Yes. (The "Jennifer Aniston Neuron" study).
But concepts are usually distributed networks.
**Optogenetics:**
We can now use light to activate specific memory neurons in mice.
We can make a mouse "Remember" fear of a specific room, even if it was never shocked there. Inception is real.

### Fact Box
*   **Savant Syndrome:** Kim Peek (Rain Man) could read two pages at once (Left eye left page, Right eye right page) and remember 98% of 12,000 books. But he couldn't button his shirt. It suggests our brains filter out most data to function. Savants have no filter.

## Introduction: The Camera
The eye is a biological camera.
**Cornea/Lens:** Focus light.
**Iris:** Aperture (f-stop).
**Retina:** Sensor (Film).
But the sensor is weird.
It is inside out. The blood vessels are *in front* of the pixels (Photoreceptors).
Your brain edits out the shadows of the veins.

## 1. Rods and Cones
**Rods (120 Million):** Black and white. High sensitivity (Night vision). Motion detection. Peripheral.
**Cones (6 Million):** Color. Low sensitivity (Daylight). Center (Fovea).
**The Blind Spot:**
Where the optic nerve leaves the eye, there are no sensors.
You have a hole in your vision.
Close one eye. Move your thumb. It disappears.
Why don't you see a black hole?
The Brain **Fill Tool**. It copies the texture from the surrounding area and pastes it in.

## 2. Processing (V1, V2, V3...)
The signal goes to the back of the head (Occipital Lobe).
It is an assembly line.
**V1:** Detects Lines and Edges.
**V2:** Shapes.
**V4:** Color.
**V5:** Motion.
**Akinetopsia (Motion Blindness):**
If V5 is damaged, you see life as a strobe light slideshow.
You can't pour coffee because you see the cup empty, then suddenly overflowing. You don't see the pouring.

## 3. Color is Fake
There is no "Red" in the universe. There is only 700nm wavelength.
Red is a sensation created by the brain.
**The Mantis Shrimp:**
Humans: 3 Color channels (RGB).
Mantis Shrimp: 12 Color channels. They see UV, Polarized light.
They see a rainbow we can't even imagine.
**Color Constancy:**
Look at a banana in sunlight. It reflects Yellow light.
Look at a banana in a nightclub (Blue light). It reflects Blue light.
Your brain *knows* it's a banana, so it subtracts the blue and tells you "It's Yellow".
This is why "The Dress" (Blue/Black vs White/Gold) broke the internet. Some brains subtracted the yellow light, some subtracted the blue shadow.

### Fact Box
*   **Saccades:** Your eyes jerk 3 times a second. During the jerk (Saccade), you are blind. The brain pauses time and stitches the scenes together. You are blind for 40 minutes every day and don't know it. Look in a mirror. Look Left eye, Right eye. You never see your eyes move.
