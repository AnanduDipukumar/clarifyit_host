## Introduction: The Knpckerbocker Trust
In October 1907, the US Stock Market crashed 50%.
A failed attempt to corner the copper market led to a run on the **Knickerbocker Trust** (a major bank).
When the bank failed, panic spread.
People lined up to withdraw their money from every bank in New York.
The government was helpless (there was no Central Bank).
The country was staring at total financial oblivion.

## 1. The Library Room
**J.P. Morgan** (70 years old, semi-retired) returned to New York.
He summoned the city's top bankers to his private library.
He locked the door. He put the key in his pocket.
He told them: "Nobody leaves until you pledge $25 million to save the trust companies."
They argued for hours. Morgan played solitaire and smoked cigars.
Finally, at 4:45 AM, they signed the pledge.

## 2. The Aftermath
Morgan single-handedly injected liquidity into the system, saving the New York Stock Exchange from closing.
But the US government realized it was dangerous to rely on one old man to save the world.
In 1913, they created the **Federal Reserve** to do Morgan's job officially.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Panic of 1907** was a severe financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt the US banking system. With no central bank to act as a lender of last resort, **J.P. Morgan** organized a coalition of financiers to inject massive liquidity into failing banks. His personal intervention ended the panic but highlighted the need for systemic reform, leading directly to the creation of the **Federal Reserve System** in 1913.

## Introduction: The ERM
In 1990, the UK joined the **Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)**.
This pegged the British Pound to the German Mark.
If the Mark went up, the Pound had to go up.
But Germany had high interest rates (to fight inflation). The UK had a recession (and needed low rates).
The peg was unsustainable.

## 1. The Short
George Soros (Quantum Fund) saw this.
He began "shorting" the Pound (borrowing Pounds, selling them for Marks, waiting for the price to crash to buy them back cheap).
He built a **$10 Billion** short position.
On Wednesday, September 16, 1992, the selling pressure was immense.

## 2. The Defense
The Bank of England tried to defend the peg.
They spent £27 billion of reserves buying up Pounds.
They raised interest rates from 10% to 12%... then to 15% in a single day.
It didn't work. The market kept selling.
At 7:00 PM, the UK surrendered. They exited the ERM.
The Pound crashed. Soros made **$1 Billion** in one day.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Black Wednesday** (1992) occurred when currency speculators, led by **George Soros**, forced the British government to withdraw the Pound Sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Despite the Bank of England spending billions in reserves and hiking interest rates to 15%, they could not combat the selling pressure. The event demonstrated that market forces can overwhelm central banks when a currency peg is fundamentally misaligned.

## Introduction: 2:32 PM
On May 6, 2010, the US economy was normal.
At 2:32 PM, the Dow Jones plunged **998.5 points** (9%) in minutes.
It was the biggest intraday point drop in history.
Stocks like Accenture and Procter & Gamble traded for pennies.
Then, just as fast, it recovered.
By 3:08 PM, the market was back to normal.
What happened?

## 1. The Navinder Sarao Theory
The SEC eventually arrested a guy in his parents' basement in London: **Navinder Singh Sarao**.
He used an algorithm to "Spoof" the market.
He placed thousands of massive sell orders (to scare the market down) and cancelled them milliseconds before they executed.
But on May 6, he spooked the High-Frequency Trading (HFT) bots.
The bots (which trade in microseconds) saw the sell pressure, panicked, and started dumping stocks to each other.
It was a **Feedback Loop** of algorithms reacting to algorithms.

## 2. Fragility
The Flash Crash proved that the modern market isn't human.
It is a network of machines.
And sometimes, the machines hallucinate.
It led to the implementation of "Circuit Breakers" (automatic pauses) to prevent it from happening again.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **2010 Flash Crash** was a trillion-dollar stock market crash that lasted approximately 36 minutes. It was triggered by "spoofing" algorithms (specifically attributed to trader Navinder Singh Sarao) which tricked High-Frequency Trading (HFT) bots into a selling spiral. It exposed the fragility of automated market structures and led to new regulations on algorithmic trading.

## Introduction: Land and Money
In the early 2000s, President Robert Mugabe seized white-owned commerical farms.
Food production collapsed (-60%).
The economy tanked.
To pay its debts (and soldiers), the government just printed money.
This created **Hyperinflation**.

## 1. The Numbers
In 2008, inflation reached **79,600,000,000%** per month.
Prices doubled every 24 hours.
If you bought a beer, you had to pay for it *before* you drank it, because by the time you finished, the price would have gone up.
Stores stopped accepting currency. They used barter or US Dollars.
The government printed higher and higher denominations: 1 Million, 1 Billion, 100 Trillion.
Eventually, the paper was worth more than the face value.

## 2. The End
In 2009, Zimbabwe abandoned its currency.
The 100 Trillion dollar notes are now sold as novelty items on eBay.
It is a brutal lesson in Monetary Theory: Money only has value if people trust the government that issues it.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Zimbabwean Hyperinflation** (2007-2009) is one of the worst instances of hyperinflation in history, peaking at nearly 80 billion percent month-on-month. Caused by the collapse of the agricultural sector (land reform) and unrestrained money printing to finance government debt, it destroyed the local currency, leading to the issuance of the infamous **100 Trillion Dollar Note** before the country demonetized and switched to foreign currencies.

## Introduction: Reparations
After WWI, Germany owed massive debts (Reparations) to France and Britain.
They couldn't pay.
So France invaded the Ruhr (Germany's industrial heartland) to take payments in coal.
The German government told workers to strike (Passive Resistance).
To pay the striking workers, the government printed money.
Floods of it.

## 1. The Spiral
In 1922, a loaf of bread cost 160 Marks.
By late 1923, it cost **200,000,000,000 Marks**.
People took wheelbarrows of cash to buy groceries.
Thieves stole the wheelbarrows and left the cash.
It was cheaper to burn money for heat than to buy wood.
The middle class (who had savings in banks) was wiped out overnight. Their life savings couldn't buy a coffee.

## 2. The Consequence
The chaos destroyed faith in democracy (The Weimar Republic).
It creates a power vacuum.
A young agitator named Adolf Hitler tried a coup (The Beer Hall Putsch) in 1923. He failed then.
But the memory of the inflation scared Germans so much that when the Great Depression hit in 1929, they turned to the man who promised stability.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Weimar Hyperinflation** (1921-1923) devastated the German economy after WWI. Triggered by war debt (reparations) and the French occupation of the Ruhr, the government printed excessive currency to pay striking workers. The resulting devaluation wiped out the savings of the middle class, destabilized the democratic government, and created the social unrest that facilitated the eventual rise of National Socialism.
