## Introduction: The Scrap Merchant
In 1925, the **Eiffel Tower** was rusting. Maintenance costs were high.
Parisians hated it (they called it a "useless monstrosity").
Newspapers rumored the government might tear it down.
**Victor Lustig**, a con man reading the paper, saw an opportunity.

## 1. The Setup
He forged government stationery.
He invited five wealthy scrap metal dealers to a secret meeting at the Hotel de Crillon.
He told them: "The city cannot afford the upkeep. We are selling it for scrap. But it must be a secret to avoid public outcry."
He picked the most insecure dealer, **Andre Poisson**.
Poisson wanted to buy the tower to gain status in society.

## 2. The Sale
Poisson hesitated. Lustig realized he was losing the fish.
So Lustig leaned in and confessed: "I am a corrupt official. My salary is low..."
Poisson understood immediately. He wasn't being scammed; he was being offered a bribe!
This made the deal feel *real* to Poisson.
He paid the bribe + the price of the tower (about 70,000 francs).
Lustig took the train to Vienna with a suitcase of cash.

## 3. The Punchline
Poisson was too embarrassed to go to the police.
So one month later, Lustig came back to Paris... **and tried to sell it again.**
This time, the victim went to the police. Lustig fled to America.
There, he conned Al Capone (by returning his money to gain trust) and printed counterfeit money.
He died in Alcatraz. On his death certificate, under "occupation," it said: "Salesman."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Victor Lustig** was a master con artist who famously posed as a French government official in 1925 to "sell" the Eiffel Tower for scrap metal to a gullible businessman. His genius lay in his understanding of human psychology—specifically, that admitting to a small crime (taking a bribe) made his larger lie (selling a national monument) seem credible.

## Introduction: The Hype
In 2017, Bitcoin was skyrocketing. Everyone wanted in.
**Bitconnect (BCC)** promised a miracle.
You convert your Bitcoin into BCC tokens, "lend" them to their Trading Bot, and earn **1% interest per day**.
If you do the math (compound interest), placing $1,000 would make you $50 million in 3 years.
Finance professors screamed "Ponzi Scheme!"
Investors screamed "FUD!" (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

## 1. Carlos Matos
They held a massive conference in Thailand.
An investor named **Carlos Matos** ran onto the stage.
He screamed: **"BITCONNECCCCTTTT!"**
His unhinged excitement became the defining meme of the crypto bubble.
He represented the pure, blind euphoria of greed.

## 2. The Collapse
In January 2018, regulators in Texas and North Carolina issued Cease and Desist orders.
Bitconnect shut down the lending platform.
The price of BCC crashed from **$400 to $0.40** in hours.
Billions of dollars of retail money evaporated.
The "Trading Bot" never existed. It was a classic Ponzi: paying old investors with new investors' money.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Bitconnect** was a cryptocurrency lending platform that operated a massive Ponzi scheme from 2016 to 2018. By promising impossible returns (up to 40% per month) supposedly generated by a "volatility trading bot," it lured in thousands of investors. Its collapse wiped out over $2 billion in value, leaving behind only the infamous "Wassa Wassa" meme.

## Introduction: The DAX Darling
**Wirecard** was a payment processor (like Stripe).
It processed payments for casinos and porn sites (industries traditional banks avoided).
It grew so fast it replaced Commerzbank in the **DAX 30 Index**.
CEO **Markus Braun** was a hero. COO **Jan Marsalek** was the genius operator.

## 1. The Financial Times
 journalist **Dan McCrum** spent 5 years investigating them.
He claimed Wirecard was faking its profits.
Wirecard responded by spying on him and hiring hackers to frame him.
Germany's financial regulator (BaFin) even filed a criminal complaint against the *journalists*, not the company.
National Pride blinded the regulators.

## 2. The Missing Cash
In 2020, auditors (EY) finally asked to see the bank statements for €1.9 billion supposedly sitting in trust accounts in the Philippines.
The banks in the Philippines said: "We've never heard of you."
The documents were photoshopped.
The money (a quarter of their balance sheet) never existed.

## 3. The Escape
Markus Braun was arrested.
Jan Marsalek calmly walked out of the office, boarded a private jet to Belarus, and disappeared.
He is currently one of the world's most wanted fugitives (rumored to be a Russian spy).
Wirecard collapsed, wiping out €24 billion.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Wirecard** was a massive German fintech fraud that collapsed in 2020 after admitting that €1.9 billion in cash—supposedly held in Asian banks—did not exist. The scandal exposed deep failures in regulatory oversight (BaFin) and auditing, and ended with the arrest of CEO Markus Braun and the dramatic flight of COO Jan Marsalek to Russia.

## Introduction: The Energy Giant
In 2000, Enron was the 7th largest company in America.
It didn't just sell gas; it traded energy derivatives, bandwidth, and even weather futures.
It was the "Google" of its day.

## 1. Mark-to-Market Accounting
Enron used a trick called **Mark-to-Market**.
If they signed a 20-year deal worth $20 billion in *future* revenue, they would book the entire profit *today*.
If the deal later failed? They didn't update the books.
They were booking imaginary profits from day one.

## 2. Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)
But they also had real losses.
CFO **Andrew Fastow** created hundreds of shell companies (named after Jurassic Park characters like "Raptor").
He sold Enron's bad assets to these companies.
Who owned these companies? Fastow.
Who paid for them? Enron (using stock).
It was a shell game to hide debt from Wall Street.

## 3. The Collapse
When the stock price started falling, the SPV guarantees failed.
The debt came rushing back onto the balance sheet.
Enron declared bankruptcy in 2001.
20,000 people lost their jobs and their pensions.
Their auditor, **Arthur Andersen** (one of the Big Five), was complicit and destroyed documents. They dissolved too.
It led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Enron** was an American energy company that collapsed in 2001 due to massive accounting fraud. By using **Mark-to-Market** accounting to book hypothetical future profits and **Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)** to hide billions in debt, executives Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay inflated the stock price, enriching themselves while wiping out the savings of thousands of employees.

## Introduction: The Cryptoqueen
**Dr. Ruja Ignatova** was perfect.
She had a PhD from Oxford. She was glamorous. She spoke at Wembley Arena in a red ballgown.
She launched **OneCoin** in 2014.
She promised it was faster and safer than Bitcoin.
People from 175 countries invested **$4 billion**.

## 1. The Missing Blockchain
In 2016, a blockchain expert named **Bjorn Bjercke** was offered a job at OneCoin.
They offered him a huge salary to "build a blockchain."
He asked: "Wait, you've been selling this for 2 years. You don't have a blockchain yet?"
They didn't.
OneCoin was just an **SQL Database**.
They could just type "You have 1,000 coins" into a spreadsheet.
It was counterfeit money sold as a revolution.

## 2. The Disappearance
In October 2017, just as the FBI was closing in, Ruja boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens.
She vanished.
Some say she is hiding on a yacht in the Mediterranean. Some say she was killed by the Bulgarian mafia.
She is currently the only woman on the **FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives** list.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **OneCoin** was a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme promoted by **Ruja Ignatova**. Unlike Bitcoin, OneCoin did not have a blockchain; it was a centralized Ponzi scheme. Ignatova disappeared in 2017 with over $4 billion in investor funds and remains one of the world's most wanted fugitives.
