## Introduction: The Pendulum
Bipolar Disorder is a biological rhythm gone wrong.
**Mania:** You don't sleep. You write a novel in 3 days. You spend your life savings. You feel like God.
**Depression:** You can't move. You want to die.
Then, it repeats.

## 1. Creativity and Madness
Why hasn't evolution deleted it?
Because Mania is productive.
Many great artists and leaders had it (Churchill, Van Gogh).
The gene for Bipolar is linked to high intelligence and creativity.
It is a dangerous gift.

## 2. Treatment
Lithium is the gold standard. It stabilizes the mood.
But patients hate it. They miss the "High" of mania.
"I felt like I could touch the stars, and now I'm just normal."
The tragedy is that the Mania burns the brain, making the next Depression worse.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Bipolar Disorder** (formerly Manic Depression) is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (Mania or Hypomania) and lows (Depression). During mania, an individual feels euphoric and invincible; during depression, they feel hopeless. It is often treated with mood stabilizers like Lithium, but adherence is difficult due to the seductive nature of the manic state.

## Introduction: The Break
Schizophrenia means "Split Mind", but it doesn't mean split personalities.
It means a split from Reality.
**Positive Symptoms:** Hallucinations (Voices), Delusions (The CIA is watching me).
**Negative Symptoms:** No emotion (Flat affect), no motivation.
It usually strikes in early 20s.

## 1. Dopamine Hypothesis
The brain is flooded with Dopamine.
Dopamine creates *Salience* (Meaning).
Normally, a red car is just a car.
With too much Dopamine, the red car is a MESSAGE.
Alles ist bedeutend. Everything is significant.
The brain connects dots that shouldn't be connected.

## 2. The Stigma
They are rarely violent. They are usually the victims of violence.
With medication (Antipsychotics), the voices stop.
But the side effects (weight gain, tremors) are brutal.
It is the cancer of mental illness.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Schizophrenia** is a chronic brain disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It is characterized by a disconnection from reality, including hallucinations (hearing voices), delusions (false beliefs), and disorganized thinking. It is typically treated with antipsychotics that regulate dopamine transmission, but it remains one of the most debilitating and stigmatized conditions.

## Introduction: The Glitch
We all have intrusive thoughts ("What if I jump off this bridge?").
Normal brains filter them out. "That's silly."
The **OCD** brain gets stuck. "Omg, I'm a killer."
This is the **Obsession**.
To neutralize the anxiety, you do a ritual.
This is the **Compulsion**. (Checking the lock 10 times).

## 1. The Cycle
Obsession (Fear) -> Anxiety -> Compulsion (Ritual) -> Relief.
But the Relief is temporary. The Fear comes back stronger.
The Ritual feeds the Monster.
If you wash your hands until they bleed, it's not because you like cleanliness. It's because you are terrified of contamination.

## 2. ERP
The cure is **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**.
You touch the "Dirty" doorknob. And you *don't* wash your hands.
You sit with the anxiety. Ideally, you realize you didn't die.
The brain rewires. But it is torture to go through.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)** is an anxiety disorder characterized by unwanted, recurring thoughts (Obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (Compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform. Common themes include contamination, symmetry, and forbidden thoughts. It is a debilitating cycle of fear and temporary relief, unrelated to simply "liking things tidy."

## Introduction: Stuck in Time
Trauma isn't just a bad memory.
It is a memory that didn't file correctly.
Normal memories go to the Library (Hippocampus). "That happened in the past."
Traumatic memories stay in the Alarm Center (Amygdala).
They feel like they are happening *right now*.

## 1. Triggers
A smell (diesel), a sound (fireworks).
The Amygdala fires. Adrenaline floods the system.
You are not remembering the war; you are *reliving* it.
You fight, flight, or freeze.

## 2. Post-Traumatic Growth
It's not just soldiers. Car crashes, abuse, assault.
But there is hope. **MDMA Therapy** and EMDR are showing massive success.
They help the brain move the memory from the Alarm Center to the Library.
"It happened. But it's over."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. It is caused by the brain's failure to process the traumatic memory as a past event, keeping the nervous system in a constant state of "High Alert."

## Introduction: Anti-Social Personality Disorder
Doctors don't use the terms "Psychopath" or "Sociopath" anymore. The diagnosis is **ASPD**.
But the distinction is useful.
**Empathy:** The ability to feel what others feel. They don't have it.
They view people as objects to be used.

## 1. The Psychopath (Born)
It is genetic. Small Amygdala.
They are cold, calculated, and charming.
They plan.
They become CEOs, Surgeons, Lawyers... or Serial Killers (Ted Bundy).
They mimic emotions but don't feel them.
"I know the words, but not the music."

## 2. The Sociopath (Made)
It is environmental (Severe abuse/trauma).
They are hot-headed, erratic, and impulsive.
They can't hold a job. They fit the "Joker" archetype.
They might form attachments to *one* person, but hate everyone else.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> While used interchangeably in pop culture, **Psychopaths** are generally seen as suffering from a genetic lack of empathy and impulse control (Cold/Calculated), while **Sociopaths** are products of environmental trauma (Hot/Erratic). Both fall under **Anti-Social Personality Disorder (ASPD)**. They lack a conscience and view others as tools, often masking their nature with superficial charm.
