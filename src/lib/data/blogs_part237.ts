## Introduction: Vimes' Boots
In *Men at Arms*, Terry Pratchett wrote:
A rich man buys $50 boots that last 10 years.
A poor man can only afford $10 boots that last 1 season.
Over 10 years, the rich man spends $50.
The poor man spends $100... and his feet are still wet.

## 1. The Trap
You can't buy in bulk (Toilet paper is cheaper at Costco, but you can't afford a membership).
You pay late fees (because paychecks don't align with bills).
You pay high interest (Payday loans).
**The Poverty Trap** is a self-reinforcing cycle where having no capital makes everything more expensive.

## 2. Escape Velocity
To escape, you need a "Big Push" (Capital).
If you give a poor farmer a bag of fertilizer, he eats a little better.
If you give him a Tractor, he becomes rich.
But he can never save enough for a tractor while buying cheap boots.

> The **Poverty Trap** is an economic mechanism that makes it very difficult for people to escape poverty. It is created by a combination of limited access to credit, lack of capital investment, and the higher relative cost of living for the poor (The **Boots Theory**).

## Introduction: The Loan Shark
In Bangladesh, women made bamboo stools.
But they had to borrow money for bamboo from a trader at crazy interest rates.
They made a profit of 2 pennies a day (Slave labor).
Muhammad Yunus (Professor) lent $27 to 42 women out of his own pocket.
They paid him back. With interest.

## 1. Grameen Bank
He founded **Grameen Bank**.
He lent to "Groups" of 5 women.
Social Collateral: If one person didn't pay, the others couldn't borrow.
Repayment rates were 98% (Higher than Wall Street).

## 2. The Critique
Microfinance became a global craze.
However, it isn't a silver bullet.
Some lenders became predatory (High interest).
Some people used the loans for weddings, not businesses.
But it proved that "Poor" does not mean "Unreliable."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Microfinance** provides small loans (microcredit) to individuals who lack access to traditional banking. Pioneered by **Muhammad Yunus**, it aims to empower entrepreneurs in developing countries to start businesses and build credit. While critics argue about its impact on long-term poverty reduction, it revolutionized financial inclusion.

## Introduction: Automation
Robots are taking jobs (Trucks, Cashiers, maybe Blog Writers).
How do people eat when there is no work?
**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**.
No drug tests. No forms. Just a check.

## 1. The Argument For
**Freedom:** People can leave abusive jobs. They can start businesses (Safety net).
**Efficiency:** Welfare bureaucracy is expensive. Just cutting checks is cheap.
**Result:** Studies (Finland, Kenya) show people *don't* quit working. They actually work *more* (or study). Health and crime improve.

## 2. The Argument Against
**Cost:** It costs Trillions. (Taxes must rise).
**Inflation:** If everyone has $1,000, landlords might just raise rent by $1,000.
**Purpose:** Work gives life meaning. UBI might create a zombie class.
It is the biggest debate of the 21st century.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is a sociopolitical financial transfer policy where all citizens of a given population regularly receive a set amount of money from the government without a means test or work requirement. Proponents see it as a solution to AI-driven unemployment; opponents fear inflation and loss of productivity.

## Introduction: The Netherlands
In 1959, the Netherlands found a huge Gas Field.
Yay! riches!
But then... their economy crashed. Manufacturing died. Unemployment rose.
Why?

## 1. The Mechanism
Foreigners bought the Gas. They had to buy Dutch Guilders to pay for it.
The Guilder became super expensive (Strong currency).
Suddenly, Dutch cheese and tulips were too expensive for foreigners to buy.
Factories closed. Everyone focused on Gas.
When the Gas price dropped... the country had nothing left.

## 2. The Resource Curse
This is the **Resource Curse**.
It happens in Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia.
Easy money leads to corruption and dictatorship ("I don't need taxes, so I don't need to listen to the people").
The only country to beat it? Norway. (They put the oil money in a piggy bank and didn't spend it).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dutch Disease** is the apparent causal relationship between the increase in the economic development of a specific sector (usually natural resources like Oil) and a decline in other sectors (like Manufacturing). The new wealth strengthens the currency, making other exports uncompetitive and leading to an unbalanced, fragile economy.

## Introduction: Clipping
In the old days, coins were made of real silver.
People would shave the edges off ("Clipping") and melt the shavings.
The clipped coin was "Bad Money" (less silver).
But the shopkeeper still had to accept it as $1.

## 1. The Hoarding
If you had a shiny, full-weight coin ("Good Money") and a clipped coin ("Bad Money")...
You would *spend* the clipped one and *keep* the shiny one.
Soon, only clipped coins are in circulation. The good coins are hidden in chests.
**"Bad Money Drives Out Good."**

## 2. Modern Example
Pre-1964 US quarters are 90% silver.
You never see them in change.
People hoard them. They spend the copper-nickel sandwich coins.
It applies to everything. If a company treats good workers and lazy workers the same... the good workers leave (Hoarded), and the lazy workers stay (Circulated).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Gresham's Law** is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good." If there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will be hoarded and disappear from circulation, while the less valuable commodity will be used for transactions.
