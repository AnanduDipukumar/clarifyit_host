## Introduction: The Anti-Reason
The 1700s (The Enlightenment) was obsessed with Logic, Science, and Order.
The 1800s (Romanticism) was the rebellion.
Artists screamed: "What about Feeling? What about Nature?"
They didn't paint Kings or Gods.
They painted **Storms, Ruins, and Ghosts**.
They wanted to feel the **Sublime**.

## 1. The Sublime
Edmund Burke defined the Sublime as: **"Beauty mixed with Terror."**
A flower is Beautiful.
A tornado is Sublime.
It makes you feel small.
"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" (Friedrich) captures this.
The man is alone, facing the infinite chaos of nature.
It brings you closer to God than a church ever could.

## 2. Frankenstein
Romanticism wasn't just paintings.
Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is the ultimate Romantic novel.
It warns against Science (Enlightenment) going too far.
It champions the "Holy Savage".
Romanticism laid the groundwork for modern environmentalism and individualism.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Romanticism** (1800-1850) was an artistic and intellectual movement that emphasized **Emotion** and **Individualism** as a reaction against the Industrial Revolution and the rationalism of the Enlightenment. It focused on the **Sublime**—the awe-inspiring and terrifying power of nature—championing the intuitive over the scientific.

## Introduction: Freezing the Action
Renaissance art (Michelangelo's David) is calm. David is standing there, thinking *before* the fight.
Baroque art (Bernini's David) is mid-swing. He is biting his lip, twisting his body.
Baroque is about **Motion**.
It was funded by the Catholic Church to fight the Protestants (Counter-Reformation).
"Make the church look so cool they have to come back."

## 1. Chiaroscuro (Tenebrism)
Caravaggio invented cinematic lighting.
He painted pitch-black backgrounds and blasted the subject with a single spotlight.
This is **Chiaroscuro** (Light-Dark).
It creates instant drama.
It highlights the dirty fingernails and the wrinkles.
Caravaggio used prostitutes and beggars as models for Saints.
The church laypeople were shocked, but they couldn't look away.

> **Mental Model: The Theater**
> Think of Renaissance art as a photograph.
> Think of Baroque art as a frame from a Christopher Nolan movie.
> Same subject, but higher contrast, more motion, and more emotional manipulation.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Baroque** (1600-1750) is a style characterized by exaggerated motion and clear detail used to produce drama and grandeur. Key techniques include **Chiaroscuro** (extreme contrast between light and dark) and **Tenebrism**. It was heavily used by the Catholic Church to evoke awe and spiritual intensity in response to the Protestant Reformation.

## Introduction: The Sunday Afternoon
"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte."
It looks like a normal painting from far away.
Get close.
It is millions of tiny dots.
Seurat spent 2 years tapping his brush. Tap. Tap. Tap.
Why?

## 1. Optical Mixing
If you mix Blue and Yellow paint, you get Green. But it's a muddy green (Subtractive Mixing).
Seurat realized if you put a Blue dot *next* to a Yellow dot...
From a distance, your eye merges them into a **Vibrant Green**.
This is **Additive Mixing** (like pixels on a TV screen).
The green glows because the blue and yellow light waves are hitting your retina simultaneously.
He called it **Chromoluminarism**.

## 2. Analog Pixels
Seurat invented the Pixel in 1884.
He treated art as a science.
He was methodical, cold, and precise.
It is the opposite of the messy, emotional Impressionists, even though they lived at the same time.
He proved that reality is just a resolution problem.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Pointillism** is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. It relies on the ability of the eye and mind to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones (**Optical Mixing**). Developed by Georges Seurat, it foreshadowed the CMYK printing process and digital displays.

## Introduction: The Shredder
2018. Sotheby's Auction.
Banksy's "Girl with Balloon" sells for $1.4 Million.
The gavel bangs.
Suddenly, a beeping noise.
The painting slides through the frame.
There was a shredder built inside the frame.
It shredded itself live on camera.
The art world went crazy. The shredded scraps are now worth *more* ($25 Million).

## 1. Stencils
How does Banksy paint so fast without getting caught?
He doesn't paint on the wall.
He cuts **Stencils** (cardboard cutouts) at home.
He walks up to a wall, sprays over the stencil in 30 seconds, and leaves.
This technique allows for complex images with zero loitering time.

## 2. Institutional Critique
Banksy mocks the Art World.
He hangs his own art in the Louvre (illegally) next to the Mona Lisa.
He sells original pieces for $60 at a street stall in NYC (nobody bought them because they thought they were fakes).
He proves that **Context is Value**.
Art is only worth millions because a rich guy says it is.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Banksy** is an anonymous England-based street artist and political activist. His satirical street art combines dark humor with graffiti executed in a distinctive **stenciling technique**. His work offers a subversive commentary on capitalism, war, and the absurdity of the high-end art market itself.

## Introduction: The Great Wave
You know the image. A giant claw-like wave threatening three boats. Mount Fuji tiny in the background.
It is arguably the most famous Asian artwork in history.
It is not a painting.
It is a **Woodblock Print**.
Hokusai carved the negative space out of wood, inked it, and pressed paper on it.
He made thousands of copies.
It was cheap art for the common people (Pop Art of the 1800s).

## 1. Japonisme
In 1853, Japan opened its borders.
These prints flooded Europe.
European artists (Monet, Van Gogh, Degas) were shocked.
Japanese art didn't use **Perspective** or Shadows.
It used flat colors, bold outlines, and cropped compositions (like a snapshot).
Van Gogh copied them obsessively.
**Ukiyo-e** killed Realism and gave birth to Modern Art.

## 2. The Floating World
"Ukiyo" means "Floating World".
It referred to the red-light districts of Edo (Tokyo).
Theaters, Geishas, Sumo Wrestlers.
It was an art form celebrating the fleeting pleasures of city life.
Living for the moment, because life is short.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ukiyo-e** ("Pictures of the Floating World") is a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Artists produced **Woodblock Prints** and paintings of such subjects as female beauties, sumo wrestlers, and landscapes. Its flat perspective and bold lines heavily influenced the **Impressionists** in Europe, a phenomenon known as Japonisme.
