## Introduction: The Nazi Titanic
The **LZ 129 Hindenburg** was the largest aircraft ever built (800 feet long).
It had a dining room, a piano, and a smoking room (pressurized to prevent sparks).
It was designed to use **Helium** (non-flammable).
But the US had a monopoly on Helium and refused to sell it to Nazi Germany.
So they used **Hydrogen** (extremely flammable).

## 1. The Landing
May 6, 1937. Lakehurst, New Jersey.
There was a thunderstorm. The air was electrically charged.
As the Hindenburg dropped its landing lines, a spark jumped from the wet rope to the frame.
The Hydrogen ignited.
It didn't explode; it burned. Rapidly.
The entire ship was consumed in **34 seconds**.

## 2. The PR Disaster
35 people died. (Surprisingly, 62 survived by jumping out the windows).
But it was the first major disaster captured on **Newsreel Film**.
Herbert Morrison's radio commentary ("Oh, the humanity!") became legendary.
The visual of the burning skeleton ended the age of the Airship instantly.
People realized: "Maybe floating in a bomb isn't safe."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Hindenburg Disaster** (1937) was the fiery destruction of the German passenger airship LZ 129. Forced to use flammable **Hydrogen** instead of safe Helium due to a US embargo, the ship ignited during landing in New Jersey, likely due to a static electricity spark. The shocking newsreel footage effectively ended the era of rigid airship travel.

## Introduction: Union Carbide
The Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) plant in Bhopal made **Sevin** (a pesticide).
To make it, they stored immense quantities of **Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)**.
MIC is one of the most toxic substances known to man. It boils at 39°C.
On the night of December 2, 1984, safety systems were turned off to save money.

## 1. The Reaction
Water leaked into Tank 610, which held 42 tons of MIC.
Water + MIC = Heat.
The tank became a pressure cooker.
The safety valve blew.
A cloud of white gas drifted over the sleeping city.

## 2. The Panic
MIC is heavier than air. It sank to the ground, filling the slums surrounding the factory.
People woke up coughing, their eyes burning (MIC causes blindness).
They ran. But running makes you breathe faster, inhaling more poison.
3,000 died that night.
15,000 died in the following years.
Half a million people suffered permanent damage.

## 3. Justice?
The CEO, Warren Anderson, fled India and never returned.
Union Carbide paid $470 million in settlement (about $500 per victim).
The site is still contaminated today.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Bhopal Gas Tragedy** (1984) was the worst industrial accident in history. A leak of **Methyl Isocyanate** gas from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in India killed thousands of people in their sleep and injured half a million more. The disaster was caused by a combination of poor maintenance, disabled safety systems, and corporate negligence.

## Introduction: Tip No. 7
Aberfan was a coal mining village.
For 50 years, the National Coal Board had been dumping waste rock (spoil) on top of a mountain above the village.
They built a man-made mountain 111 feet high.
They built it directly over an underground spring.
Engineers warned them. They ignored the warnings.

## 1. The Collapse
October 21, 1966. 9:15 AM.
After days of heavy rain, the water liquefied the base of the pile.
Tip No. 7 turned into a black tsunami.
It slid down the mountain at 80 mph.

## 2. Pantglas Junior School
The slide didn't hit the houses first. It hit the school.
The classrooms were instantly filled with wet black sludge.
The children had just returned from assembly.
Villagers rushed to dig them out with their bare hands. But the slurry hardened like concrete.
**116 children** and **28 adults** died.

## 3. The Betrayal
The Coal Board denied responsibility. They called it an "Act of God."
They even forced the disaster fund (charity money donated by the public) to pay for the removal of the *other* dangerous tips.
It was a double tragedy of physics and bureaucracy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Aberfan Disaster** (1966) occurred when a spoil tip of coal waste collapsed onto the village of Aberfan in Wales. The landslide engulfed Pantglas Junior School, killing 116 children and 28 adults. It was caused by the National Coal Board's negligence in piling waste over natural springs, leading to soil liquefaction.

## Introduction: The Iron Dam
The Banqiao Dam was built in the 1950s.
Soviet engineers designed it to withstand a "1-in-1,000 year flood."
They called it the "Iron Dam." It was unbreakable.
But nature is good at breaking things.

## 1. Typhoon Nina
In August 1975, Typhoon Nina stalled over Henan Province.
It dumped **one year's worth of rain** in 24 hours.
The dam was full. The sluice gates were blocked by silt.
At 1:00 AM on August 8, the dam broke.

## 2. The Chain Reaction
700 million cubic meters of water were released instantly.
A wave, 10 kilometers wide and 20 feet high, rushed down the valley at 30 mph.
It hit the next dam downstream. That dam broke.
Then the next.
In total, **62 dams** collapsed in a domino effect.

## 3. The Toll
Entire towns were erased.
26,000 people died in the flood.
145,000 people died later from famine and disease (the water polluted the wells).
It is the deadliest structural failure in human history.
The Chinese government kept it a state secret until 2005.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Banqiao Dam Failure** (1975) was a catastrophic collapse of 62 dams in Henan, China, caused by unprecedented rainfall from **Typhoon Nina**. The initial breach triggered a chain reaction of failures downstream, releasing a massive deluge that killed an estimated 171,000 to 230,000 people. It remains the deadliest dam failure in history, though its details were suppressed for decades.

## Introduction: The Pea Souper
London was famous for its fog (Dickensian fog).
But December 1952 was different.
It was cold, so everyone burned coal in their fireplaces.
An **Anticyclone** settled over the city, trapping the air like a lid on a pot.
The smoke had nowhere to go.
It turned yellow-black. It smelled like rotten eggs.

## 1. Zero Visibility
The smog was so thick you couldn't see your own feet.
Buses stopped running (conductors had to walk in front with flashlights).
People wandered into the Thames and drowned.
Birds crashed into buildings.
But the real danger was breathing.

## 2. Sulfuric Acid
The coal smoke contained Sulfur Dioxide.
It reacted with the water in the fog to form **Sulfuric Acid**.
Londoners were breathing acid.
Hospitals filled up with people gasping for air (Blue lips).
The graveyards ran out of coffins.
4,000 died in 5 days. 8,000 more died in the following weeks.

## 3. The Clean Air Act
The government initially denied it ("It's just the flu").
But the death toll was undeniable.
In 1956, they passed the **Clean Air Act**, banning black smoke emissions.
It was the beginning of modern environmental protection laws.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Great Smog of London** (1952) was a severe pollution event caused by a temperature inversion that trapped coal smoke over the city. The smog, which was highly acidic due to sulfur dioxide, caused near-zero visibility and killed an estimated 12,000 people from respiratory failure. It directly led to the passing of the **Clean Air Act of 1956**.
