## Introduction: The Monkey Sphere
Robin Dunbar (Anthropologist) studied primates.
He found a correlation between **Neocortex Size** and **Group Size**.
Monkeys who groom each other can only manage a certain number of relationships.
For humans, that number is **150**.
If a village gets bigger than 150, it splits.
If a startup gets bigger than 150, you need HR and Managers (Bureaucracy).

## 1. The Circles of Intimacy
Dunbar says our relationships are like an onion.
*   **5:** Loved ones (Spouse/Best friends).
*   **15:** Good friends (Stag party).
*   **50:** Friends (Dinner party).
*   **150:** Meaningful Contacts (You would stop to say hello at the airport).
*   **1500:** Faces you recognize.
You physically cannot maintain 500 "Best Friends". You don't have the time or brainpower.

> **Mental Model: Social Entropy**
> Relationships decay.
> To keep a friend, you must invest time (Energy).
> Since your time is finite, your relationships are finite.
> Social Media (Facebook) tricks us into thinking we have 2,000 friends. We don't. We have 2,000 strangers we spy on.

## 2. The Corporate Limit
W.L. Gore (Gore-Tex) limits factories to 150 people.
When the parking lot hits 150 spaces, they build a new factory down the road.
Why?
Below 150, peer pressure works ("Don't be lazy, Bob").
Above 150, Bob becomes a number. He can hide. You need a Manager to watch Bob.
150 is the limit of **Trust without Rules**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dunbar's Number** (approx. 150) is the cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. Based on the size of the human **Neocortex**, it dictates the size of hunter-gatherer tribes, military companies, and efficient corporate teams. Exceeding this number requires formal hierarchy and laws to maintain order.

## Introduction: The Line Test
1951. Solomon Asch put 7 people in a room.
6 were actors. 1 was the victim.
He showed them lines. Line A was clearly longer than Line B.
The actors all said: "Line B is longer."
The victim looked confused. He squinted.
When it was his turn, 37% of the time, he said: "Line B is longer."
He denied his own vision to fit in.

## 1. Normative Conformity
Why?
*   **Informational Conformity:** "Maybe they know something I don't. Maybe my eyes are bad."
*   **Normative Conformity:** "I know they are wrong, but I don't want to be the weirdo."
Prior to the experiment, experts predicted <1% would conform.
The reality was shocking.
Human beings are pack animals. We fear **Social Exclusion** more than being wrong.

## 2. The Power of One
Asch found a cure.
 If just **One Actor** gave the correct answer... conformity dropped by 75%.
You don't need a majority to fight the mob.
You just need a **Single Ally**.
It breaks the spell of unanimity.

> **Mental Model: The Abilene Paradox**
> A family goes to Abilene for dinner.
> The food is bad. The drive is long.
> On the way back, they realize *nobody* wanted to go.
> They all assumed the *others* wanted to go, so they agreed to be polite.
> Groups often make decisions that *no individual member* actually wants.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Asch Conformity Experiments** demonstrated the power of **Peer Pressure**. When confronted with a unanimous group giving a clearly wrong answer, a significant percentage of individuals yielded to the group consensus rather than trust their own senses. It highlights our deep-seated biological drive for social cohesion over objective truth.

        description: "Engineers dimmed the lights to see if productivity dropped. Productivity went up. They brightened the lights. It went up again. Why?",

## Introduction: The Factory
1920s. Western Electric's Hawthorne Works (Chicago).
Researchers wanted to optimize the factory.
Does better lighting help?
They increased the light -> Productivity went up.
They decreased the light -> Productivity went up.
They changed break times -> Productivity went up.
Whatever they did, the workers worked harder.

## 1. The Observer Effect
The workers weren't reacting to the lights.
They were reacting to **Being Watched**.
Someone (a scientist in a lab coat) was paying attention to them.
They felt special. They felt accountable.
The moment the study ended and the scientists left... productivity slumped back to normal.
**Observation modifies Behavior.**

## 2. In Modern Life
This is why you run faster when you pass someone on the jogging trail.
This is why employees slack off when the boss leaves the office.
This is why Placebos work better in clinical trials (where doctors call you every day) than in real life.
We are performing for an audience.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Hawthorne Effect** is the alteration of behavior by the subjects of a study due to their awareness of being observed. Originally discovered during lighting experiments at the Hawthorne Works factory, it implies that simply **Measuring** a process improves it, often confounding scientific studies.

## Introduction: Primary vs Secondary
A kid steals a candy bar.
**Scenario A:** The shopkeeper yells at him. He feels guilty. He stops. (Primary Deviance).
**Scenario B:** He is arrested. The school suspends him. People call him a "Problem Child".
He thinks: "Well, if I'm a bad kid, I might as well do bad things."
He joins a gang.
This is **Secondary Deviance**.
The *Reaction* to the crime caused the Career in crime.

## 1. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Labeling Theory (Howard Becker) argues that "Deviance is not a quality of the act, but a consequence of the application of rules."
Once you label someone (Criminal, Insane, Failure), they internalize the label.
It becomes their **Master Status**.
It overshadows everything else ("He is a felon").
Society cuts off their legitimate options (Wait, you can't get a job?), pushing them back into deviance.

> **Mental Model: The Pygmalion Effect**
> This works positively too.
> Research shows if teachers are told a random student is a "Genius", that student's grades go up.
> The teacher treats them with more patience. The student gains confidence.
> We become what we are called.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Labeling Theory** posits that self-identity and behavior are influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them. Deviance is socially constructed; by labeling an individual as "deviant" or "criminal," society creates a stigma that isolates them and encourages further deviant behavior (Secondary Deviance) as a defense mechanism or necessity.

## Introduction: The Cockroach Race
Robert Zajonc (1969) built a stadium for cockroaches.
He made them run a simple maze.
When other cockroaches watched (from clear boxes), the runner ran **Faster**.
Then he made the maze complex.
When watched, the runner ran **Slower**.
This is **Social Facilitation**.

## 1. Arousal
An audience increases **Physiological Arousal** (Adrenaline).
Adrenaline boosts your **Dominant Response**.
*   **If you are an Expert:** Your dominant response is "Success". The crowd makes you perform better (The NBA Star).
*   **If you are a Novice:** Your dominant response is "Mistakes". The crowd makes you crumble (The Nervous Student).
The crowd functions as an amplifier.

## 2. Evaluation Apprehension
It's not just the presence of people.
It's the fear of judgment.
If the audience is blindfolded, the effect disappears.
We are wired to care about status.
If we think we are winning, we show off.
If we think we are failing, we freeze (Buck Fever).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Social Facilitation** is the tendency for people to perform differently when in the presence of others. It improves performance on **Simple/Well-Rehearsed** tasks but impairs performance on **Complex/New** tasks. The presence of an audience creates arousal, which enhances the individual's dominant response—making experts better and beginners worse.
