## Introduction: Cosmic Rays
Cosmic rays are usually tiny protons moving fast.
But on October 15, 1991, a detector in Utah saw something impossible.
A single particle with **3 x 10^20 electronvolts** of energy.
That is 20 million times more energetic than the particles in the Large Hadron Collider.

## 1. Speed
It was traveling at 99.99999999999999999999951% the speed of light.
If you raced this particle and a beam of light to the Andromeda Galaxy (2.5 million light years away)...
The light would win by **0.0000046 millimeters**.
It was practically light.

## 2. The Mystery
Where did it come from?
A Supernova isn't strong enough. A Black Hole jet isn't strong enough.
Physics says it shouldn't exist because of the **GZK Cutoff** (it should lose energy hitting the background radiation of space).
But it hit us.
Was it a flaw in the detector? Or a message from a galaxy far, far away?

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Oh-My-God Particle** was an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray detected in 1991. It possessed kinetic energy equivalent to a baseball moving at 60 mph, packed into a single subatomic particle. Its existence challenges our understanding of particle physics, as no known astronomical source gets powerful enough to accelerate matter to such distinct speeds.

## Introduction: The Ruins
1987, Brazil. An old radiotherapy institute was abandoned.
Two men broke in and stole a heavy lead canister.
They pried it open. Inside was a salt that glowed blue in the dark.
They thought it was magical.

## 1. The Spread
The owner of the scrapyard invited friends to see the "Carnival Glitter."
His 6-year-old niece ate a sandwich with blue dust on her hands.
People painted crosses on their shirts.
Days later, everyone started vomiting. Skin turned black and fell off.

## 2. The Cleanup
It was one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.
Four people died. 249 were contaminated.
Entire houses had to be demolished and sealed in concrete.
It showed the terrifying danger of "Orphan Sources" (lost nuclear material).
It is why nuclear waste is tracked so carefully today.

> The **Goiânia Accident** (1987) occurred when scavengers stole a radiotherapy source (Cesium-137) from an abandoned hospital in Brazil. Unaware of its danger, they distributed the glowing blue substance to family and friends. The incident highlighted the risks of radioactive source security and resulted in four deaths and widespread contamination.

## Introduction: The Big Ear
Jerry Ehman was reviewing data from the Big Ear radio telescope in Ohio.
He saw a sequence of characters: **6EQUJ5**.
This code meant the signal strength hit the maximum limit (30 sigmas above noise).
He circled it in red pen and wrote **Wow!**.

## 1. Why it was weird
The signal was at 1420 MHz (The Hydrogen Line).
Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe.
Many scientists believe aliens would use this frequency as a "Universal Calling Channel."
The signal rose and fell over 72 seconds—exactly the time it takes for the Earth's rotation to scan a point in the sky.
It came from space. Not a satellite. Not a plane.

## 2. Silence
We pointed the telescope back at the constellation Sagittarius. Silence.
For 50 years, we have listened. Nothing.
Was it a passing comet? A secret spy satellite? Or a brief "district dialing error" from a civilization that has since moved on?

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Wow! Signal** was a strong narrowband radio signal detected in 1977 that appeared to originate from the constellation Sagittarius. Its intensity, frequency (Hydrogen Line), and modulation suggested an artificial extraterrestrial origin. Despite decades of searching, it has never been detected again, remaining the strongest candidate for alien contact.

## Introduction: Ice Cream
In 1963, Erasto Mpemba was making ice cream at school.
He was late, so he put his hot milk mixture directly into the freezer without cooling it.
His ice cream froze *before* his classmates' cold mixture.
His physics teacher told him he was wrong. "That's not physics, that's Mpemba's Physics."
But Mpemba was right.

## 1. The Theory
How can hot water (which has further to go to reach 0°C) win?
Theories include:
*   **Evaporation:** Hot water loses mass (steam), so there is less water to freeze.
*   **Convection:** Hot water moves faster, spreading heat to the container walls.
*   **Dissolved Gas:** Heating removes gas bubbles, changing the freezing point.
*   **Hydrogen Bonds:** The bonds in hot water are stretched, storing energy that is released violently upon cooling (The "Spring" effect).

## 2. Verdict?
We still don't agree on exactly why.
It reminds us that water is the weirdest chemical in the universe.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Mpemba Effect** is a counter-intuitive physical phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water under certain conditions. Named after Erasto Mpemba, who rediscovered it in the 1960s, the exact mechanism is still debated, with explanations ranging from evaporation and convection currents to the relaxation of hydrogen bonds.

## Introduction: Project Rainbow
The legend says that in October 1943, the *USS Eldridge* was in Philadelphia.
The Navy was testing "Unified Field Theory" (Einstein) to make the ship invisible to radar.
They turned on the generators. Green fog appeared.
The ship disappeared.
It reappeared in Norfolk, Virginia (200 miles away), then teleported back.
Sailors were fused into the metal deck. Others went insane.

## 1. The Source
The story comes from one man: Carl Allen ("Carlos Allende").
He sent letters to the Navy filled with incoherent rambling.
He annotated a book on UFOs.

## 2. The Reality
The *USS Eldridge* was never in Philadelphia on that date.
The "Green Fog" was likely St. Elmo's Fire (plasma discharge).
The "Invisibility" was probably "Degaussing" (making the ship magnetic-neutral to avoid mines).
Physics doesn’t work like magic.
But the story survives because we *want* to believe the government is hiding wizards.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Philadelphia Experiment** is an alleged military experiment supposed to have been carried out by the U.S. Navy in 1943. The conspiracy theory claims the destroyer *USS Eldridge* was rendered invisible or teleported. Historical records show the ship was elsewhere, and the story is widely considered a hoax perpetuated by Carl Allen, misinterpreting misunderstood naval degaussing procedures.
