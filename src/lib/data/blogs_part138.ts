## Introduction: The 100 Trillion Bill
I have a 100 Trillion Dollar bill from Zimbabwe on my desk.
It is real.
In 2008, it wasn't enough to buy a bus ticket.
People wiped their ass with cash because toilet paper (an import) was more valuable than the currency.
Money is not wealth. Money is **Trust**.
When trust breaks, money reverts to its intrinsic value: Paper.

## 1. The Death Spiral
How does it start?
1.  **Debt:** The government owes money it doesn't have.
2.  **Printing:** They print money to pay the debt.
3.  **Inflation:** More money chasing same goods -> Prices rise.
4.  **Reaction:** The public panics. They spend money *immediately* (Velocity of Money increases).
5.  **Loop:** The government prints *faster* to keep up with prices.
In Hungary 1946, prices doubled every **15 hours**.
Waiters announced new prices halfway through dinner.

## 2. Weimar Germany (1923)
The classic case.
Germany owed War Reparations (Treaty of Versailles) in Gold.
They didn't have Gold. They had Paper Marks.
They printed Marks to buy Gold.
Result: 1 Dollar = 4 Trillion Marks.
People burned cash in stoves because it burned longer than the wood you could buy with it.
Children played with stacks of cash like Lego.
The Middle Class (Savers) was wiped out.
**Consequence:** The anger and chaos paved the way for Hitler.

## 3. The Cure
How do you stop it?
You can't "fix" the currency. It's dead.
You have to kill it.
1.  **Dollarization:** Zimbabwe stopped using their money. They use US Dollars now.
2.  **Hard Peg:** Peg the new currency to Gold or a stable currency.
This is brutal. The government can no longer spend. Pensions stop. But stability returns.

> **Mental Model: Velocity of Money**
>
> Inflation = Money Supply $\times$ Velocity.
> Usually, money moves slowly.
> In Hyperinflation, money is a hot potato.
> Everyone tries to get rid of it instantly.
> This drives prices up even if the government stops printing.
> It is a psychological avalanche.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hyperinflation** is a monetary collapse where inflation exceeds 50% per month. It is caused by a feedback loop of **Money Printing** to finance debt and a collapse in **Public Trust**. As the **Velocity of Money** spikes (people spending instantly), the currency becomes worthless. Historical examples like **Weimar Germany** and **Zimbabwe** show that it wipes out the middle class and often leads to political extremism.

## Introduction: The Robot Tax
Truck Drivers. Call Centers. Radiologists. Coders.
AI creates "Technological Unemployment".
If machines do the work... and nobody has a job... who buys the products?
Capitalism breaks if velocity stops.
**Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is the proposed patch.
Every citizen gets $1,000/month. No questions asked.
The "Capitalist Floor".

## 1. The Argument For (Leverage)
It's not about being lazy. It's about leverage.
If you know you won't starve...
*   You can quit your abusive boss.
*   You can start a business.
*   You can leave a bad marriage.
It effectively ends extreme poverty.
Studies (Finland/Alaska) show that people on UBI **do not stop working**.
They actually work *better* jobs because they aren't desperate.

## 2. The Argument Against (Inflation)
1.  **Cost:** Giving 300 Million Americans $1k/month costs $3.6 Trillion a year. That is almost the entire Federal Budget.
2.  **Inflation:** If everyone has $1,000 extra... Landlords will just raise rent by $1,000. The price of bread goes up.
The money has to come from somewhere (Taxing the Robots/Wealthy).
If you just print it -> Hyperinflation.

## 3. The Alaska Permanent Fund
We already do it.
Alaska has oil.
Every year, the state sends a check ($1,000-$2,000) to every resident. A share of the oil profits.
Alaskans love it. It is political suicide to touch it.
It proves that "Free Money" doesn't turn people into communists. It turns them into consumers.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Richard Nixon:** In 1969, Nixon (a Republican) almost passed UBI. The "Family Assistance Plan". It passed the House. It failed in the Senate because Democrats argued it wasn't generous *enough*. We were one vote away from a UBI world 50 years ago.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is a policy where all citizens receive a regular, unconditional cash payment. Proponents argue it is the necessary solution to **AI Automation** and wealth inequality, providing a safety net that encourages entrepreneurship. Critics argue it is fiscally impossible and would trigger **Inflation**. Real-world trials (Alaska, Finland) suggest it improves mental health without significantly reducing employment motivation.

## Introduction: The Household Lie
Politicians love to say: "The Government is like a household. We must balance the checkbook. We can't spend more than we make."
**MMT says: Lie.**
You (Household) are a **Currency User**. You have to earn dollars.
The US Gov is a **Currency Issuer**. It can create dollars.
It can never "run out" of dollars. It can never go bankrupt (unless it chooses to).
It can pay for Healthcare, Green Deals, and War instantly.

## 1. The Real Limit (Inflation)
So why not print infinite money?
**Inflation.**
The limit is not money; the limit is **Real Resources** (Labor, Steel, Oil).
If you print money to build a bridge, but there are no workers... you just bid up the price of workers.
Spending is constrained by the capacity of the economy, not the deficit.

## 2. Taxes Delete Money
If the government doesn't need taxes to spend... why do we pay them?
1.  **To Create Demand:** You *need* dollars to pay tax, so you work for dollars.
2.  **To Cool Inflation:** Taxes are an HVAC system.
    *   Economy too hot (Inflation)? **Raise Taxes** (Delete money).
    *   Economy too cold (Recession)? **Cut Taxes** (Leave money).
Taxes are an inflation-control tool, not a revenue tool.

## 3. The Job Guarantee
MMT proposes: The Government should be the "Employer of Last Resort".
Anyone who wants a job gets one at minimum wage.
Doing what? Building infrastructure, caregiving, cleaning.
This sets a minimum standard for the private sector.
Spending creates the money. Taxes destroy it. The Cycle.

> **Mental Model: The Scoreboard**
>
> Imagine a stadium.
> The Stadium controls the scoreboard.
> Can the Stadium "run out of points"?
> No. It types them in.
> The Public Deficit is just the Private Sector's Surplus.
> If the Gov has -$100 (Deficit), the People have +$100 (Savings).
> **A balanced budget means the Public has $0 savings.**

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)** argues that sovereign nations with fiat currencies (like the US) are not constrained by revenue, but only by **Inflation** and **Real Resources**. It posits that **Taxes** function to regulate demand and enforce currency usage, not to fund spending. Critics warn that relying on politicians to raise taxes to curb inflation is politically naive and risks hyperinflation.

## Introduction: The Short
Hedge Funds (Melvin Capital) thought GameStop was the next Blockbuster.
Dying. Malls are dead.
So they **Shorted** it.
(Borrowed the stock, sold it, hoping to buy it back cheaper).
They got greedy.
They shorted **140%** of existing shares.
This is a mathematical bomb.
They bet more shares than actually existed.

## 1. Roaring Kitty (The Spark)
Keith Gill (DeepFuckingValue). A random guy in a basement with a red headband.
He noticed the 140%.
He told r/WallStreetBets.
The Thesis: **"If we buy the stock and never sell... they can't close their position."**
Supply = 0.
Demand = Infinite (They *must* buy to cover).
Price = Infinity.
**The Short Squeeze.**

## 2. To The Moon
In Jan 2021, the Ape Army attacked.
GameStop (GME) went from $4 to $483.
Melvin Capital lost **$6 Billion** in weeks.
Regular people paid off student loans.
It was poetic justice. Ideally, the "Smart Money" was actually the "Dumb Money".
"We can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

## 3. The Buy Button
Then, the Empire struck back.
**Robinhood** (the app) halted buying.
You could only sell.
The momentum crashed.
Conspiracy?
Robinhood said it was a "Liquidity Issue" with the clearing house.
Users said: "The Elites made a phone call."
It revealed the system is rigged. The Casino unplugged the machine when the player started winning.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Diamond Hands:** The slang was half the battle.
> **Diamond Hands:** Holding despite fear.
> **Paper Hands:** Selling early.
> **Tendies:** Profits.
> It was a financial cult that weaponized memes to destroy billionaires.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **GameStop Short Squeeze** was a market phenomenon driven by retail investors (Reddit) exploiting an over-leveraged **Short Position** (140%) held by hedge funds. By coordinating to buy and hold ("Diamond Hands"), they forced the price up, triggering a feedback loop where funds had to buy at any price to cover losses. It highlighted the power of **Decentralized Coordination** and the fragility of Wall Street leverage.

## Introduction: Hard Money
The Dollar is "Soft Money". The Fed can print infinite amounts.
Bitcoin is "Hard Money".
Detailed in the code by Satoshi Nakamoto:
**Total Supply:** 21 Million. (Never more).
**Inflation Rate:** Cuts in half every 4 years.
This is **The Halving**.
50 BTC -> 25 -> 12.5 -> 6.25 -> 3.125.

## 1. Stock-to-Flow Model
Plan B (Quantitative Analyst) applied Gold models to Bitcoin.
**Stock:** How much exists currently.
**Flow:** How much is made per year.
Gold has a high Stock-to-Flow (Hard to find new gold).
After a Halving, Bitcoin's Flow drops. Its Stock-to-Flow doubles.
It becomes "Harder" than Gold.
According to Supply & Demand... if Supply drops and Demand stays same... Price MUST rise.

## 2. The 4-Year Cycle
History rhymes.
*   **2012 Halving:** Price $12 -> $1,000 (2013).
*   **2016 Halving:** Price $600 -> $20,000 (2017).
*   **2020 Halving:** Price $9,000 -> $69,000 (2021).
It creates a predictable boom/bust cycle.
Miners who are inefficient go bankrupt. Only the strong survive.

## 3. The End Game (2140)
The Halvings continue until 2140.
Then the reward hits 0.
No more new Bitcoin.
Miners will be paid only in **Transaction Fees**.
Will the network survive?
Critics say: Without the subsidy, security will drop.
Believers say: Bitcoin will be the Global Reserve Asset, so fees will be enough.

> **Mental Model: Difficulty Adjustment**
>
> Why can't computers just work harder to mine more?
> Because of the **Difficulty Adjustment**.
> Every 2 weeks, the network checks how fast blocks are being mined.
> If too fast -> It makes the puzzle harder.
> If too slow -> It makes it easier.
> It ensures a steady heartbeat of 10 minutes per block, no matter how many supercomputers join the network.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Bitcoin Halving** is a pre-programmed deflationary event occurring every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), where the mining reward is cut by 50%. This reduces the inflation rate and increases the **Stock-to-Flow Ratio**, historically strengthening the asset's price via a supply shock. It ensures that Bitcoin remains digitally scarce (capped at 21 million) and distinguishes it from fiat currencies prone to inflationary printing.
