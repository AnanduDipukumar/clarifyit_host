## Introduction: Crystal vs Glass
Metals (Steel, Gold) are Crystals. Their atoms line up in neat rows.
Glass is Amorphous. Its atoms are a chaotic mess.
If you cool a metal *extremely* fast (1,000,000 degrees per second), the atoms don't have time to line up.
It freezes in chaotic liquid form.
This is **Metallic Glass** (Amorphous Metal).

## 1. The Superbounce
Because it has no crystal boundaries (weak points), it is immensely strong.
If you drop a steel ball bearing on steel, it bounces a few times and stops (energy is lost vibrating the crystals).
If you drop it on Metallic Glass (Liquidmetal), it bounces for minutes.
It returns almost 100% of the elastic energy.

## 2. Uses
Apple bought the rights to Liquidmetal (used in SIM ejector tools).
NASA uses it for gears in space (no lubrication needed).
It is the future of resilient robotics.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Metallic Glass** (Amorphous Metal) is creating by cooling molten metal so rapidly that it bypasses crystallization, retaining a liquid-like atomic structure. This unique structure gives it superior yield strength, elasticity, and wear resistance compared to crystalline metals like steel or titanium.

## Introduction: The Crack
Concrete cracks. Water gets in. It rusts the steel bars inside. The building collapses.
It costs billions in repairs.
But ancient Roman concrete didn't crack.
Why?

## 1. The Secret Ingredient
Scientists found "Lime Clasts" in Roman concrete.
When it rains, these clasts dissolve and recrystallize to fill the cracks.
We are copying this using **Bacteria**.

## 2. Bio-Concrete
We mix dormant bacteria (Bacillus) and food (Calcium Lactate) into the cement.
They sleep for decades.
When a crack opens and water enters, the bacteria wake up.
They eat the food and poop out **Limestone**.
The limestone fills the crack. The bacteria go back to sleep.
The building heals itself like skin.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Self-Healing Concrete** mimics biological repair mechanisms. By embedding bacteria or special mineral capsules within the mix, the material can autonomously repair micro-cracks before they spread. This technology promises to double the lifespan of infrastructure and drastically reduce the carbon footprint of cement production.

## Introduction: The Brick
Old laptop chargers were huge bricks.
They got hot. Heat = Wasted Energy.
Silicon has hit its limit. It can't switch electricity fast enough without burning up.

## 1. The Blue Crystal
**Gallium Nitride (GaN)** was used for blue LEDs (Nobel Prize).
We realized it is a "Wide Bandgap Semiconductor."
It can handle much higher voltages than silicon.
It switches faster. It stays cooler.
This means components can be smaller.

## 2. The Future
The Grid.
If we replace the silicon transformers in the power grid with GaN, we could save enough electricity to power the entire UK.
It is the quiet revolution in power electronics.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is replacing silicon in power electronics. It conducts electrons 1000x more efficiently, allowing for smaller, faster, and cooler chargers and transformers. It is the technology behind the new generation of ultra-compact "GaN Fast" chargers.

## Introduction: Lignin
Wood is 50% air. It is held up by Cellulose (strong) and glue called Lignin.
Scientists at the University of Maryland stripped out the Lignin and the air.
They compressed the wood at 100°C.

## 1. Densified Wood
The result is **Super Wood**.
It is 12x stronger than natural wood.
It is stronger than steel (by weight).
It can stop a bullet (it shatters it).

## 2. Why?
Steel and concrete are terrible for the environment (CO2).
Wood is renewable. It stores Carbon.
We could build skyscrapers out of Super Wood that are lighter, cheaper, and greener than steel towers.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Super Wood** (Densified Wood) is created by chemically removing lignin from natural wood and compressing it under heat. The result is a material with the tensile strength of steel but 6x lighter. It offers a sustainable, carbon-negative alternative to metal and concrete in construction.

## Introduction: Hello Computer
In *Star Trek IV*, Scotty gives a 20th-century engineer the formula for "Transparent Aluminum."
Sci-Fi writers made it up.
But it exists.
**Aluminum Oxynitride (ALON)**.

## 1. Ceramic Glass
It isn't a metal; it's a ceramic.
It is 4x harder than glass.
It stops a .50 caliber bullet that would shatter bulletproof glass.
It is almost as hard as sapphire.

## 2. The Cost
Why don't we have see-through soda cans?
Cost. It is expensive to make ($10 per square inch).
It is used for the windows of the International Space Station and lenses for missile sensors.
But one day, your phone screen might be made of it.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Aluminum Oxynitride** (ALON) is a transparent ceramic composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. Often dubbed "Transparent Aluminum" (a nod to *Star Trek*), it is optically clear but incredibly hard and scratch-resistant. It is primarily used in military armor and aerospace windows where glass is too fragile.
