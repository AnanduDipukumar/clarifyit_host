## Introduction: The Sky Gods
Vanuatu (Melanesia), 1940s.
The US Military arrived.
They brought "Cargo": Coke, Spam, Chocolate, Jeeps.
They gave some to the natives.
The natives asked: "Where did this come from?"
"From the sky."
Then the war ended. The US left. The Cargo stopped.

## 1. The Rituals
The natives wanted the Cargo back.
They observed what the Americans did.
1.  They built runways out of cleared jungle.
2.  They built Control Towers out of bamboo.
3.  They wore headphones made of carved wood.
4.  They marched with sticks like rifles.
They thought: "If we perform the ritual, the planes will land."
This is **Sympathetic Magic**.

## 2. John Frum
They worship a messiah named "John Frum" (John From... America?).
He is depicted as a white serviceman.
On Feb 15 (John Frum Day), they march.
They believe he will return with free refrigerators for everyone.
It looks funny to us... until you realize we do the same thing.

## 3. Feynman's Cargo Cult Science
Richard Feynman used this as a metaphor.
"Cargo Cult Science":
You have the lab coats. You have the graphs. You have the peer review.
But you are missing the *truth*.
You are just mimicking the form of science without the substance.
We are all just natives building bamboo planes, hoping for a result.

### Fact Box
*   **Prince Philip:** One tribe (Yaohnanen) worships Prince Philip (Queen Elizabeth's husband) as a god. He once visited them. They were ecstatic. When he died in 2021, they held a massive mourning ritual. They are now debating whether Charles is the new god.

## Introduction: The Kwakwaka'wakw
Pacific Northwest Tribes.
A Chief holds a feast.
He gives guests blankets, copper shields, canoes, and food.
Thousands of dollars worth.
Sometimes, he **burns it**.
Why?

## 1. Status through Loss
To show: "I am so rich, I can destroy this and not care."
If I give you a gift, I am superior. You are in my debt.
To regain your honor, you must hold a *bigger* Potlatch and give me *more*.
It is an **Economic War**.
"Fighting with property."
It redistributes wealth (the poor get the blankets), but it bankrupts the Chiefs.

## 2. The Ban
The Canadian Government banned it in 1884.
"It is irrational and wasteful."
They wanted the Indians to be Capitalists (Accumulate wealth).
The Indians saw Capitalism as hoarding (Greed).
To them, a rich man who keeps his money is a failure. A rich man who dies poor is a legend.

## 3. Modern Potlatch
Do we do this?
Buying a round of drinks at the bar.
"No, I got it." "No, let me pay."
Weddings. (Spend $50k to impress guests).
Philanthropy gals.
We still fight for status by burning money. We just call it "Charity".

### Fact Box
*   **Copper Shields:** The ultimate status symbol. A sheet of beaten copper. In a "Rivalry Potlatch", a Chief would break a piece off his shield and give it to his rival. "Here, I broke $10,000. Can you break $11,000?" If the rival couldn't, he was shamed.

## Introduction: Malinowski
Bronislaw Malinowski (Father of Anthropology) lived in the Trobriand Islands (PNG) during WWI.
He saw men sailing hundreds of miles in canoes.
They carried two things:
1.  **Soulava:** Red shell necklaces. (Move Clockwise).
2.  **Mwali:** White shell armbands. (Move Counter-Clockwise).

## 1. The Rules
You meet your partner on another island.
You give him a Necklace.
He gives you an Armband.
You keep it for a year. Then you pass it to the next partner.
You cannot buy them. You cannot keep them.
They have no utility. You don't wear them.
So why do it?

## 2. Social Glue
The Islands are hostile. Headhunters.
The Kula Ring creates a **Peace Treaty**.
"He is my Kula partner. If I visit his island, he will protect me."
It allows *real* trade (Yams, Pottery, Pigs) to happen safely under the cover of the ritual trade.
The shells are the "Passport".

## 3. Delayed Reciprocity
If I give you a shell today, you might not give me one back for 2 years.
I must trust you.
This builds long-term bonds.
Capitalism is "Instant Reciprocity" (Cash for goods). No trust needed.
Gift Economies require deep trust.

### Fact Box
*   **Vaygu'a:** The shells have names and histories. "This is the necklace that Chief Tom wore when he died." Holding a famous shell gives you fame, even if only for a year. It's like holding the Stanley Cup.

## Introduction: Marvin Harris
Cultural Materialism.
Strange religious rules usually have a practical economic reason.
"God said so" is just the marketing.

## 1. The Sacred Cow (India)
Why kill a cow? You get 500 lbs of meat (One meal).
Why keep a cow?
1.  **Milk:** Calories every day for years.
2.  **Oxen:** You need male cows to plow the fields. No plow = No wheat = Starvation.
3.  **Dung:** Fuel for fire (in a land with few trees) and fertilizer.
A live cow is a factory. A dead cow is a snack.
The Taboo exists to stop farmers from eating their tractors during a drought.

## 2. The Abominable Pig (Middle East)
Pigs eat what humans eat (Grain, Tubers).
Cows eat what humans *can't* eat (Grass).
In the desert, water is scarce. Pigs need shade and water (walling).
If you raise pigs, they compete with you for food and water.
Therefore: Pigs are "Unclean" (Economically inefficient).
God banned them to save the grain supply.

## 3. The Dog (West)
Dogs are carnivores.
To eat a dog, you must feed it meat.
It is inefficient to feed meat to an animal just to eat the animal.
Also, dogs are useful (Hunting, Guarding).
The rule: **"Don't eat your tools"**.
Exceptions: Cultures where meat is scarce or dogs are useless (e.g., crowded cities) might eat them.

### Fact Box
*   **Cannibalism:** Why don't we eat people? Prions (Kuru). Eating human brains causes holes in your brain (Mad Cow Disease). Tribes that practiced it (Fore people) almost went extinct. The taboo against cannibalism is a biological quarantine.

        description: "The dangerous space between Boy and Man. Why hazing, boot camps, and vision quests are identical.",
        category: "Anthropology",

## Introduction: Arnold van Gennep
Every Rite of Passage has 3 stages:
1.  **Separation:** You leave your old life (Shave head, leave village).
2.  **Liminality:** The transition. You are "No One". You have no name. You are suffering.
3.  **Reincorporation:** You return as a "New Person" (Graduation, Marriage).

## 1. Communitas
In the Liminal stage (Boot Camp), everyone is equal.
Rich kid or poor kid... both have shaved heads and are doing pushups in the mud.
Structure dissolves.
This creates **Communitas**: Intense comradeship. "Brothers in Arms".
The trauma bonds the group.

## 2. Hazing
Why do fraternities haze?
Why do tribes scar their skin?
To prove commitment.
"I suffered for this group, therefore this group is valuable." (Cognitive Dissonance).
If membership was free, it would be worthless.
The pain makes the identity real.

## 3. Modern Liminality
We lack rituals.
When does a boy become a man today?
At 18? 21? When he gets a job?
It is fuzzy.
This causes "Peter Pan Syndrome". Perpetual adolescence.
We need clear thresholds (The Hero's Journey) to structure our lives.

### Fact Box
*   **Airports:** Airports are "Liminal Spaces". You are not in New York. You are not in London. You are nowhere. The rules are different (Duty Free, sleep on floor). That feeling of unreality is Liminality.
