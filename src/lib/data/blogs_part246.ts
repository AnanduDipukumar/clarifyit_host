## Introduction: The Original Penguin
The word \"Penguin\" originally referred to the **Great Auk**.
(When explorers achieved naming birds in Antarctica, they said "Look, those look like Auks/Penguins", and the name stuck).
They lived in Canada, Iceland, and the UK.

## 1. The Slaughter
They were flightless and unafraid of humans.
Sailors would herd them onto planks and march them into the ship's hold.
They were used for meat, bait, and feathers.
By 1800, they were rare.
Museums and collectors started paying huge money for specimens.
This sealed their fate.
Locals hunted the last remaining breeding pair on Eldey Island in 1844 to sell them.
They smashed the last egg.

## 2. Lesson
It is the textbook example of **Overexploitation**.
We ate them all.
It happened before we understood "Extinction" was possible.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Great Auk** was a flightless bird of the alcid family that became extinct in the mid-19th century. Once abundant in the North Atlantic, it was hunted to extinction for its meat, down, and display value. The last confirmed pair was killed on Eldey Island, Iceland, in 1844.

## Introduction: The Cat
**Smilodon** (The Saber-Toothed Cat) roamed the Americas 10,000 years ago.
It was built like a bear (massive arms), not a sprinter like a lion.

## 1. The Teeth
The canines were terrifying but weak.
If they hit a bone, they would snap.
So Smilodon didn't bite and hold.
It wrestled the prey to the ground with its massive arms, then delivered a surgical slash to the throat.
Precision killing.

## 2. Why die?
It specialized in hunting Megafauna (Mammoths, Giant Sloths).
When the Megafauna died out (Climate Change + Humans), the Smilodon starved.
It couldn't catch fast deer.
Specialization leads to extinction.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Smilodon** is the most famous prehistoric mammal, known for its long canine teeth. It was an ambush predator that relied on upper body strength to pin prey before delivering a fatal bite. Its extinction (approx. 10,000 years ago) coincided with the extinction of its large herbivore prey during the Quaternary extinction event.

## Introduction: Martha
In 1914, Martha, the last Passenger Pigeon, died in the Cincinnati Zoo.
A century earlier, they were the most numerous bird on Earth.
Flocks were 1 mile wide and 300 miles long.

## 1. Industrial Hunting
The telegraph and the railroad killed them.
Hunters tracked the flocks via telegraph.
They arrived by train.
They shot them, netted them, and even burned sulfur under their trees to make them fall.
They sold them for pennies as cheap meat for slaves and poor people.
It was a massacre on an industrial scale.

## 2. The Allee Effect
They needed massive flocks to breed.
Once the population dropped below a certain point, they stopped breeding.
Social animals die fast when they are lonely.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Passenger Pigeon** went from being the most abundant bird in North America (population 3-5 billion) to extinction in a human lifetime. The combination of commercial hunting facilitated by railroads and telegraphs, and habitat destruction, serves as a stark warning that even the most massive populations can be wiped out.

## Introduction: Benjamin
1936. Hobart Zoo.
Benjamin, the last **Thylacine**, died of exposure because the keeper locked him out of his shelter.
We have video footage of him. It's haunting.

## 1. Convergent Evolution
It looked like a wolf.
But it was a Marsupial (related to Kangaroos).
Nature evolved the "Wolf Shape" twice, completely independently.
This is **Convergent Evolution**.

## 2. The Bounty
Farmers blamed the Thylacine for killing sheep.
The government put a bounty on their heads.
Later research showed their jaws were too weak to kill sheep.
They ate wallabies.
We wiped them out for a crime they didn't commit.
People still claim to see them in the wild (Cryptozoology), but they are gone.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Thylacine** (Tasmanian Tiger) was a carnivorous marsupial. It is a prime example of **Convergent Evolution**, resembling a canid despite being unrelated. It was driven to extinction in the 20th century due to bounties paid by farmers who falsely believed it threatened their livestock.

## Introduction: 252 Million Years Ago
Life almost ended.
The "Great Dying" killed 96% of marine species and 70% of land species.
Cockroaches almost died out. It was that bad.

## 1. The Traps
It wasn't a meteor.
It was **The Siberian Traps**.
A mega-volcano eruption in Russia that lasted for *1 Million Years*.
It covered a continent in lava.
But the lava wasn't the killer.

## 2. Carbon and Acid
The lava burned through coal deposits.
It released trillions of tons of CO2.
Global warming spiked by 10°C.
The oceans turned acidic.
The oxygen vanished (Anoxia).
The ocean became a pink soup of toxic bacteria releasing Hydrogen Sulfide gas.
It took life 10 million years to recover.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Permian–Triassic extinction event**, known as the Great Dying, was the most severe extinction event in Earth's history. Triggered by massive volcanic eruptions (Siberian Traps) leading to runaway global warming and ocean acidification, it wiped out nearly all life on Earth, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs.
