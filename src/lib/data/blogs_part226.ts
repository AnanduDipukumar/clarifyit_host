## Introduction: The Steve Jobs of Biotech
She wore the black turtlenecks. She lowered her voice.
She raised $700 Million. Valued at $9 Billion.
The promise: The **Edison** machine. A pinprick of blood. No scary needles.
Results in minutes.
It was the Holy Grail of healthcare.

## 1. The Reality
The Physics didn't work.
A drop of blood isn't enough sample for 200 tests.
The Edison machines were broken (blood spilled inside them).
So she secretly ran the tests on standard Siemens machines.
And she faked the data.

## 2. The Whistleblower
Tyler Shultz (Grandson of board member George Shultz) knew it was a lie.
He went to the Wall Street Journal (John Carreyrou).
The house of cards collapsed.
Holmes is now in prison.
It is the ultimate warning against "Fake It Till You Make It" in science.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Theranos** was a health technology company founded by Elizabeth Holmes that claimed to have revolutionized blood testing with a device that could perform hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood. Investigation revealed the technology was a fraud; the company was secretly using competitors' commercial analyzers. It dissolved in 2018, and Holmes was convicted of fraud.

## Introduction: Community-Adjusted EBITDA
WeWork took long-term leases on buildings, renovated them with cool neon signs and free beer, and rented them short-term.
This is a risky but boring business (Regus did it for decades).
Neumann convinced SoftBank (Masayoshi Son) it was a Tech Company.
Valuation: $47 Billion.

## 1. The Excess
Neumann was a rockstar.
He walked barefoot. He smoked weed on private jets.
He sold the trademark "We" to his own company for $6 Million.
He bought a wave pool company.
It was a Cult of Personality.

## 2. The IPO
When they tried to go public, they had to show their books.
They were losing $2 Billion a year.
Investors laughed.
The IPO was canceled. The valuation dropped to $2 Billion.
Neumann was fired (with a Billion dollar parachute).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **WeWork** is a commercial real estate company that provides flexible shared workspaces. Under co-founder **Adam Neumann**, it grew rapidly, achieving a $47 billion valuation fueled by SoftBank. Its 2019 failed IPO attempt revealed massive losses, erratic management, and self-dealing, leading to a spectacular collapse in value and Neumann's ousting. It is a case study in **Corporate Governance** failure.

## Introduction: The Exchange
FTX was a Crypto Exchange. You deposit money, you buy Bitcoin.
It is supposed to be a bank. They hold your money.
But Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) had a hedge fund: **Alameda Research**.
Alameda made bad bets. They lost money.
So SBF took the money from FTX customers and gave it to Alameda.

## 1. The Token (FTT)
To hide the hole, they printed their own money: FTT Tokens.
They claimed FTT was worth billions.
Binance (rival) noticed and sold their FTT.
The price crashed.
The hole was revealed. $8 Billion missing.

## 2. Effective Altruism
SBF claimed he wanted to make billions to give it all away (Effective Altruism).
It was a shield.
He bought politicians, stadiums, and favorable regulation.
In the end, it was just old-fashioned Embezzlement.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **FTX** was a cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) that collapsed in 2022. The firm fraudulently used customer funds to cover high-risk trading losses at its sister company, **Alameda Research**. The collapse wiped out billions in user assets and resulted in SBF's conviction for one of the largest financial frauds in US history.

## Introduction: Get Big Fast
The internet was new. Everyone knew it was the future.
VCs threw money at anything.
**Pets.com:** Sold dog food online. Shipping cost more than the food. They lost money on every sale. Strategy? "Make it up in volume."
They bought a Super Bowl ad (The Sock Puppet).
They went bankrupt 9 months later.

## 1. The Crash
The NASDAQ peaked at 5,000 in March 2000.
Then reality hit.
Companies were burning cash with no profit.
The market crashed 78%.
Trillions of dollars evaporated.
Amazon lost 90% of its value (but survived).

## 2. The Legacy
The Bubble was crazy, but it built the infrastructure (Fiber optic cables).
The survivors (Amazon, Google, eBay) became the titans of today.
It taught us that a great technology doesn't always make a great business.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Dot-com Bubble** was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculation in Internet-related companies in the late 1990s. Investors ignored traditional metrics (P/E ratio) in favor of "growth at any cost." When the bubble burst in 2000, many companies failed (Pets.com, Webvan), but the crash laid the groundwork for the modern digital economy.

## Introduction: Ginger
The codename was "Ginger".
Rumors swirled. Was it anti-gravity? A hydrogen car?
It was the **Segway**.
A self-balancing two-wheeled scooter.
Dean Kamen (inventor) claimed cars would be banned from cities.

## 1. The Flaws
It cost $5,000.
It was too heavy (100 lbs) to carry up stairs.
It was illegal on sidewalks (too fast) and illegal on roads (too slow).
You looked dorky riding it.
It solved a problem nobody had (Walking is fine).

## 2. The irony
The Segway failed, but the idea (Micromobility) won.
**Electric Scooters** (Bird, Lime) took over cities 15 years later.
Why? Because they are light, cheap ($300), and you can rent them with an app.
Being first isn't enough. You have to be right.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Segway PT** was a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter launched in 2001. Despite massive hype and backing from tech visionaries, it failed commercially due to its high price, regulatory hurdles, and lack of clear use case. It is often cited as a cautionary tale of "Solutionism"—finding a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.
