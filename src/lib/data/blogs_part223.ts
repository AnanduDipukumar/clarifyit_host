## Introduction: The Neutral Power
The USA didn't want to fight in WWI.
Wilson won the election on the slogan "He Kept Us Out of War."
Germany wanted to keep it that way.
But they made a fatal mistake.
Arthur Zimmermann (German Foreign Secretary) sent a coded telegram to Mexico.

## 1. The Offer
"We will give you Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Just attack the US."
Germany hoped this would distract the US so they wouldn't fight in Europe.
British Intelligence (Room 40) intercepted it.
They cracked the code.

## 2. The Reveal
The British had a problem. If they showed the US the telegram, Germany would know they cracked the code.
They waited for the perfect moment.
When they released it, the American public went berserk.
It was the smoking gun.
The US declared war 6 weeks later. Germany lost.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Zimmermann Telegram** was a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office in January 1917. It proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico if the United States entered World War I. British intelligence intercepted and decoded it, revealing Germany's promise to help Mexico recover Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The outrage drew the US into the war, shifting the balance of power decisively.

## Introduction: The Establishment
Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, John Cairncross.
They weren't bought with money. They were True Believers in Communism.
They rose to the very top of British Intelligence.
Kim Philby was nearly the head of MI6.
Imagine if the head of the CIA was a Russian spy. That was Philby.

## 1. The Damage
They gave Stalin everything.
The detailed plans of the Atomic Bomb.
The names of British agents in Russia (who were all executed).
Philby even betrayed his own friends.
He defected to Moscow in 1963.

## 2. Why?
They thought Capitalism was dying (Great Depression) and Communism was the future (fighting Hitler).
It shattered British trust.
If you can't trust the elite gentlemen from Cambridge, who can you trust?
It led to the paranoia of the Cold War.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Cambridge Five** was a ring of spies in the United Kingdom who passed information to the Soviet Union during World War II and into the 1950s. Recruited while students at Cambridge University, they infiltrated the highest levels of British intelligence (MI5, MI6) and diplomacy. Their betrayal caused immense damage to Western security and revealed the vulnerability of the British class system (nobody suspected "gentlemen" could be traitors).

## Introduction: H-21
Margaretha Zelle was Dutch.
She reinvented herself as "Mata Hari", an exotic dancer from Java.
She became the mistress of French, German, and Russian officers.
In WWI, pillow talk is dangerous.
The French accused her of being a German spy (Codename H-21).

## 1. The Evidence
The evidence was thin.
She admitted taking money from Germany, but said she only spied *on* them for France.
She was a Double Agent. Or maybe just a courtesan trying to survive.
France needed a scapegoat for their losses at the front.
"We are losing because of Spies!"

## 2. The Execution
She was executed by firing squad in 1917.
She refused a blindfold and blew a kiss to the soldiers.
Documents released 100 years later suggest she wasn't very effective as a spy for either side.
She was a victim of her own myth.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Mata Hari** was the stage name of Margaretha Zelle, a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I. While she fraternized with high-ranking military officers from multiple nations, modern historians argue she was likely a minor player or a scapegoat utilized by the French government to distract from military failures. She remains the archetype of the **Femme Fatale** spy.

## Introduction: Sicily
1943. The Allies wanted to invade Sicily.
It was obvious. It is the stepping stone to Italy.
Hitler knew it.
Churchill had to convince Hitler they were attacking **Greece** instead.
But how?

## 1. Major William Martin
They found a homeless man who died of rat poison (Glyndwr Michael).
They dressed him in a Royal Marines uniform.
They created a whole life for him (Letters from a fake fiancée "Pam", theater tickets, unpaid bills).
And a briefcase labeled "TOP SECRET" containing plans for the invasion of Greece.

## 2. The Drop
A submarine released the body off the coast of Spain.
It washed up. Spanish officials (pro-German) gave the briefcase to the Nazis.
Hitler swallowed the bait.
He moved his tanks to Greece.
The Allies invaded Sicily and faced almost no resistance.
A dead homeless man saved thousands of lives.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Operation Mincemeat** was a successful British deception operation during WWII to disguise the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. Intelligence officers dressed a corpse as a Royal Marines officer and planted fake correspondence indicating an invasion of Greece and Sardinia. The Germans found the body, believed the documents, and diverted forces away from Sicily, ensuring an Allied victory.

## Introduction: The Shock
In 1945, the US had the Bomb. They thought they had a monopoly for 20 years.
In 1949, The Soviets exploded their own Bomb.
How? They stole the blueprints.
The trail led to Julius Rosenberg.

## 1. The Ring
Julius was a recruiter. His brother-in-law, David Greenglass, worked at Los Alamos.
Greenglass drew sketches of the "Implosion Lens" (the secret to the bomb) and gave them to Julius.
The FBI arrested Julius and his wife Ethel.

## 2. The Chair
They refused to name names.
They were electrocuted in 1953.
Decades later, Soviet files (Venona project) confirmed Julius was a spy.
But Ethel? She likely knew, but didn't participate.
The government killed her to try to make Julius talk. It didn't work.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Julius and Ethel Rosenberg** were American citizens convicted of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. They were accused of transmitting top-secret information about radar, sonar, and jet propulsion engines, and most famously, nuclear weapon designs (The Atomic Bomb). They were executed in 1953. While Julius's guilt is confirmed by history, Ethel's level of involvement remains a controversial subject of debate.
