## Introduction: The Mission (138 BC)
The Chinese Emperor Han Wudi had a problem. The Xiongnu nomads were attacking.
He needed allies.
He sent a diplomat, **Zhang Qian**, to the West.
Zhang Qian didn't find allies.
He found **Markets**.
He found "Blood-Sweating Horses" in Uzbekistan. He found Roman Glass.
He opened the door.
The **Silk Road** was born.

## 1. Connectivity (Pax Mongolica)
The Road was dangerous. Bandits. Deserts.
It only truly flourished under the Mongols (1200s).
Genghis Khan was a butcher, but he loved trade.
He established the **Pax Mongolica**.
"A maiden with a pot of gold on her head could walk from the Black Sea to the Pacific unharmed."
If a merchant was robbed, the Khan would execute the entire local village.
Harsh? Yes. Effective? Extremely.
Ideas flowed. Gunpowder went West (cannons). Buddhism went East. Math went everywhere.

## 2. The Exchange
What moved?
*   **From China:** Silk (Secrets were guarded by death penalty), Porcelain, Paper.
*   **From West:** Gold, Silver, Wool, Glass.
*   **From India:** Spices, Cotton, The Number Zero.
It was the central nervous system of the world.

## 3. The Collapse (1453)
What killed it?
The **Ottomans**.
In 1453, they took Constantinople.
They put a heavy tax on the road.
Europeans said: "We can't pay this. We need a detour."
Columbus sailed West. Vasco da Gama sailed South.
The **Age of Sail** began.
The Silk Road turned to dust.
Until today... China's **Belt and Road Initiative** is rebuilding it.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Industrial Espionage:** For 1000 years, Rome bought Silk but didn't know how it was made. They thought it grew on trees.
> In 550 AD, Emperor Justinian hired two monks.
> They hollowed out their bamboo walking sticks.
> They smuggled **Silkworm Eggs** out of China.
> The monopoly was broken. The first great corporate theft.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Silk Road** was the ancient network of trade routes connecting East and West. Facilitated by the **Pax Mongolica**, it allowed the exchange of not just goods (Silk, Spices), but technologies (Paper, Gunpowder) and religions (Buddhism). Its closure by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 forced Europe to take to the seas, triggering the **Age of Discovery**. It was the first instance of true Globalization.

## Introduction: The Ship
October 1347. Messina, Sicily.
A Genoese ship docks.
The sailors are dead or dying. Black swellings (Buboes) in their armpits.
The rats run off the ship. The fleas jump off the rats.
**Yersinia Pestis.**
Within 5 years, **50% of Europe was dead.**
200 Million people.

## 1. The Horror
Society collapsed.
Doctors died. Priests died.
"Fathers abandoned children, wives abandoned husbands, brothers abandoned brothers."
Flagellants whipped themselves in the streets to appease God.
Jews were blamed for "poisoning the wells" and massacred (The Scapegoat).
It was Hell on Earth.

## 2. The Economic Reset
But then... something strange happened.
**The Golden Age of the Peasant.**
Before the plague, Europe was overpopulated. Labor was cheap. Peasants were slaves (Serfs).
After the plague?
Labor was scarce.
The Lord need his harvest picked.
Peasant: "I want double wages."
Lord: "No."
Peasant: "Okay, the Duke down the road offered triple."
**Wages skyrocketed.**
Serfdom collapsed. The Middle Class was born.
Diet improved (more meat).

## 3. The Renaissance
The survivors inherited the wealth of the dead.
There was suddenly surplus capital.
Rich merchants (like the Medicis) started spending money on Art and Science.
The **Renaissance** rose from the ashes of the Plague.
Disaster led to progress.
The Malthusian Trap was broken.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Quarantine:** The Venetians invented the concept.
> Ships arriving from plague ports had to anchor offshore for **40 Days**.
> *Quaranta Giorni* in Italian.
> Hence: Quarantine.
> It was the only primitive medicine that actually worked.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Black Death (1347)** was the deadliest pandemic in history, killing half of Europe. While a humanitarian nightmare, it triggered a massive economic shift. The scarcity of labor forced wages up and broke the **Feudal System**, leading to the rise of the Middle Class. The concentration of wealth among survivors ultimately funded the **Renaissance**. It is a grim example of how pandemics act as accelerators of history.

## Introduction: The Hockey Stick
Look at a graph of "World GDP per Capita" over 2000 years.
It is a flat line ($1000/year).
Roman Empire? Flat. Middle Ages? Flat.
Then, in 1750... **Vertical Line.**
What happened?
We unlocked the sun.

## 1. The Steam Engine (Watt)
Before 1750, energy came from Muscles (Horse/Human), Wind, or Water.
It was limited. If the river dried up, the factory stopped.
Thomas Newcomen built a steam pump. It was terrible.
**James Watt** fixed it (Separate Condenser).
Suddenly, we could turn **Coal** (Stored Ancient Sunlight) into **Motion**.
You could put a factory anywhere.
Energy became infinite (effectively).

## 2. Mass Production
One weaver could make 1 shirt a week.
A Steam Loom could make 500.
The price of clothes crashed. The price of iron crashed.
**The Train.**
London to Edinburgh took 2 weeks by carriage.
By train? 1 day.
The world shrank. Information and goods moved at speed.

## 3. The Cost (Dickens)
It wasn't all good.
**Urbanization.**
People left the farms for the cities (Manchester/London).
Cholera. Smog. Child Labor.
Working 16 hours a day in a dark mill.
Karl Marx saw this and wrote *The Communist Manifesto*.
The Unions formed.
Eventually, laws caught up.
But the transition was brutal.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Luddites:** We use the word to mean "People who hate technology".
> Wrong. The original Luddites were skilled weavers.
> They didn't hate machines. They hated *using machines to make low-quality trash and cut wages*.
> They smashed the machines as a labor negotiation tactic. They were the first Union.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Industrial Revolution** was the moment humanity escaped the Malthusian Trap. By harnessing fossil fuels via **James Watt's Steam Engine**, we decoupled production from muscle power. This led to exponential economic growth, urbanization, and the modern world. However, it also created massive social upheaval, pollution, and labor exploitation, birthing modern political ideologies like Socialism and Capitalism.

## Introduction: The Iron Curtain
1945. WWII ends. The Nazis are gone.
The two winners (USA and USSR) look at each other.
Ideologies that cannot coexist.
Winston Churchill: **"An Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent."**
The world split in two.
NATO vs Warsaw Pact.

## 1. MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction)
Why didn't we fight?
**Nukes.**
By 1955, both sides had Hydrogen Bombs.
Game Theory:
*   If I attack, you launch.
*   We both die.
*   Result: No one attacks.
It was a **Suicide Pact**.
"The only winning move is not to play."
It worked. It prevented WWIII.

## 2. The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
The closest we came to the end.
Khrushchev put nukes in Cuba (90 miles from Florida).
JFK blockaded the island.
The world held its breath for 13 days.
**Vasili Arkhipov:** A Russian sub captain. The US dropped depth charges on him. He thought war had started. He had a nuclear torpedo. He wanted to fire.
Arkhipov said No.
He saved the world single-handedly.

## 3. The Collapse (1991)
How did it end?
Not with a bang, but a whimper.
The USSR went broke.
It couldn't compete with the US economy (Star Wars defense program).
It couldn't feed its people.
Gorbachev tried to fix it (Glasnost/Perestroika). The system was too rotten.
The Berlin Wall fell.
Francis Fukuyama declared "The End of History".
(He was wrong, history started again pretty fast).

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Duck and Cover:** Bert the Turtle taught kids to hide under desks.
> Would a desk save you from a nuclear fireball? No.
> But it gave people a sense of control. It prevented mass panic.
> It was psychological management, not safety.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Cold War** was a 45-year geopolitical standoff between the US and USSR. Open warfare was prevented by **Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)**—the certainty that any attack would result in total annihilation. Instead, the war was fought via Proxy Wars (Korea, Vietnam), Spies, and the Space Race. It ended in 1991 when the Soviet economic system collapsed from within, leaving the US as the sole superpower.

## Introduction: The Race
1957. Sputnik. The Russians were winning.
1961. Gagarin. The Russians won again.
JFK panicked. He needed a goal so hard that the Russians hadn't started yet.
"We choose to go to the Moon in this decade... not because it is easy, but because it is hard."
He gave NASA a blank check (4% of the US Budget).

## 1. The Saturn V
Wernher von Braun (The former Nazi V2 engineer) built the beast.
**The Saturn V.**
363 feet tall.
7.5 Million pounds of thrust.
It burns 20 tons of fuel *per second*.
It is still the most powerful machine ever built.
It has never failed.

## 2. The Landing (1202 Alarm)
July 20, 1969.
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are descending in the Eagle.
The computer flashes: **1202 Alarm**.
"Executive Overflow." The computer was overloaded.
Armstrong ignored it.
He looked out the window. They were heading for a crater of boulders.
He took manual control.
He flew it like a helicopter.
Fuel: 60 seconds... 30 seconds...
"Contact Light. The Eagle has Landed."

## 3. The Perspective
Michael Collins (The 3rd Guy) stayed in orbit.
He was the loneliest human in history.
The astronauts looked back.
**The Blue Marble.**
They saw Earth without borders. A fragile blue dot in the black void.
It changed them. (The Overview Effect).
We went to the Moon to explore space, but we discovered Earth.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Space Pen:** Myth: "NASA spent millions on a pen. Russians used a pencil."
> False. Graphite dust from pencils floats in zero-G and shorts out electronics. It's dangerous.
> Paul Fisher developed the pressurized Space Pen with his own money.
> Both NASA and the Russians bought it ($6 each).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Apollo 11** was the culmination of the Space Race. Driven by Cold War competition and JFK's mandate, NASA built the **Saturn V** and developed the technology to land men on the Moon. The success on July 20, 1969, was a triumph of engineering and courage (Neil Armstrong's manual landing). It remains the only time humans have set foot on another celestial body, shifting our perspective of our place in the universe.
