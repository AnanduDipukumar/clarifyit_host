## Introduction: The Glitch
Duncan Lorimer was looking at old data from the Parkes Telescope (Australia).
He found a spike.
5 milliseconds long.
Typically, RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) comes from Earth (Microwaves, Phones).
But due to **Dispersion** (lower frequencies arrive later than high frequencies), he knew it came from *outside* the Galaxy.
Distance: 3 Billion Light Years.
Energy: Unimaginable.
He called it an FRB (Fast Radio Burst).

## 1. The Magnetar Theory
Was it Aliens? (Solar sails).
Probably not.
Leading theory: **Magnetar Starquakes**.
A Magnetar is a Neutron Star with a magnetic field $10^{15}$ Gauss (Trillion times stronger than Earth).
Sometimes, the star's crust cracks ("Starquake").
The magnetic field lines snap and reconnect (Magnetic Recoupling).
This releases a blast of X-rays and Radio waves.
It is a cosmic EMP.

## 2. The Repeater (FRB 121102)
Most FRBs happen once and vanish.
But in 2012, we found one that repeats.
Every 157 days, it wakes up.
This suggests it is an object in orbit.
Maybe a neutron star orbiting a Black Hole?
Or a wobbling top (Precession)?

## 3. The Microwave Oven Mystery (Perytons)
For years, Parkes Telescope detected "Perytons" (FRB-like signals).
Astronomers were excited.
Then they realized... the signals only happened at lunch time.
It turned out: If you open the microwave oven door *before* the timer hits zero... the Magnetron leaks a burst of radio waves.
The telescope was detecting the staff heating up their burritos.
Science is hard.

### Fact Box
*   **Chime Telescope:** Canada built a telescope *just* to find FRBs. It looks like a half-pipe skateboard ramp. It finds 1000 per year. We are mapping the universe using these pings.

## Introduction: Ejection
When solar systems form, it is chaotic.
Planets act like billiards.
Jupiter migrates inward, kicks a smaller planet, and throws it out of the system.
**Gravitational Slingshot.**
The planet flies into the void.
It becomes a **Rogue**.
Simulations suggest there are *more* Rogue Planets than Stars in the Milky Way.
Billions of dark worlds drifting in silence.

## 1. Can Life Survive?
Without a sun, it must be frozen near Absolute Zero, right?
Not necessarily.
1.  **Thick Atmosphere:** If it has a hydrogen atmosphere (like Neptune), it retains heat from formation for billions of years.
2.  **Geothermal:** Radioactive decay in the core keeps it warm.
3.  **Moons:** If the rogue has a moon, tidal friction keeps it hot. (Like Europa).
Life could exist in sub-surface oceans, completely unaware that the universe has stars.

## 2. The Wandering Earth Scenario
Could a Rogue Planet hit Earth?
Yes.
It happens without warning because they are dark (we can't see them).
If one passes through the Solar System, its gravity could eject Earth.
We would drift away from the Sun.
The oceans would freeze (top down).
We could survive in underwater cities using nuclear power. But the sky would be forever black.

## 3. Detecting the Invisible
How do we find them?
**Microlensing.**
If a Rogue passes in front of a distant star... its gravity acts as a lens.
The star gets brighter for a few days.
Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (launching 2027) is designed to hunt them.

### Fact Box
*   **PSO J318.5-22:** We found one rogue planet that is bright red. It is a Gas Giant glowing from its own internal heat. It has clouds of molten iron rain.

## Introduction: The Flow
The Universe is expanding (Hubble Flow). Everything should be moving away.
But the Milky Way (and Andromeda, and Virgo Cluster) are moving *sideways*.
We are defying the expansion.
We are being sucked towards a gravitational anomaly called the **Great Attractor**.

## 1. Zone of Avoidance
Why can't we see it?
It is hidden behind the **Zone of Avoidance**.
This is the dusty center of our own Milky Way galaxy. It blocks our view.
It is like trying to see what is behind your own head.
We have to use X-Ray and Radio telescopes to peer through the dust.

## 2. Laniakea (Immeasurable Heaven)
In 2014, Brent Tully mapped the flow of 100,000 galaxies.
He realized the Great Attractor is just the center of a Supercluster.
He named our home structure **Laniakea** (Hawaiian for "Immeasurable Heaven").
It contains 100,000 galaxies.
It spans 500 Million Light Years.
It looks like a giant glowing nervous system.
We are just a speck on one of the neurons flowing toward the brain.

## 3. Shapley Concentration
Wait, it gets worse.
The Great Attractor is moving too.
It is being pulled towards something even bigger behind it.
The **Shapley Supercluster**.
It is a nesting doll of monsters.
Does it end? Or is there an even bigger attractor behind Shapley?
We don't know limit of the cosmic web.

### Fact Box
*   ** Dipole Repeller:** Not only are we being pulled *towards* the Attractor, we are being pushed *away* from a giant void behind us. The "Dipole Repeller". The universe is a push-pull system of density and emptiness.

        description: "The Higgs Field might not be stable. If it creates a bubble of 'True Vacuum', it will expand at the speed of light and delete physics itself.",

## Introduction: Energy States
Imagine a ball on a hill.
It wants to roll to the bottom (Lowest Energy State).
Currently, the Higgs Field (which gives mass to particles) is in a valley.
We *think* it is the bottom valley (**True Vacuum**).
But what if it's a "False Valley" (**False Vacuum**)?
What if there is a deeper valley further down?

## 1. Quantum Tunneling
If the ball tunnels through the hill to the lower valley...
It releases energy.
This creates a bubble of **True Vacuum**.
Inside the bubble, the laws of physics change.
Atoms cannot exist. Chemistry stops.
The bubble expands at the speed of light.
It is an expanding sphere of "The End".

## 2. No Warning
Because it moves at light speed... you can't see it coming.
One second you are reading this blog.
The next second... you don't exist.
It destroys atoms instantly.
It is the most efficient, painless death possible.
It destroys the *information* about you.

## 3. Is it likely?
Measurements of the Top Quark and Higgs Boson mass suggest... we are right on the edge.
"Metastable".
We are balancing on a knife edge between Stable and Unstable.
If the Top Quark were slightly heavier, we would be doomed.
This implies our universe might be fine-tuned or... temporary.

### Fact Box
*   **Multiverse:** If vacuum decay happens, the "New Physics" inside the bubble might support new forms of life. We might be the "Old Universe" that has to die to make way for the "New Universe".
