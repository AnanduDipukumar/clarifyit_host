## Introduction: The Seed
Strychnine comes from the seeds of the *Strychnos nux-vomica* tree (native to India).
It was discovered in 1818.
In the 19th century, it was used as a performance-enhancing drug (at low doses).
The winner of the 1904 Olympic Marathon reportedly took Strychnine and Brandy during the race.
But at high doses, it is pure nightmare fuel.

## 1. The Mechanism
Strychnine attacks the spinal cord.
It blocks **Glycine** (the chemical that tells muscles to relax).
Without the "off switch," your nerves fire uncontrollably.
Every muscle in your body contracts simultaneously.
Since your back muscles are stronger than your stomach muscles, your body arches backward until your head touches your heels (Opisthotonos).

## 2. The Risus Sardonicus
The facial muscles contract too.
This pulls the corners of the mouth back, revealing the teeth.
It creates a terrifying, fixed grin known as the **Risus Sardonicus**.
This effect inspired the character of **The Joker** (and "Smylex" gas).
The victim is fully conscious during the spasms, aware of the pain until they suffocate.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Strychnine** is a neurotoxin derived from the nux-vomica tree. It acts as an antagonist to glycine and acetylcholine receptors, removing the body's ability to inhibit muscle contractions. This results in violent convulsions and the characteristic **Risus Sardonicus** (a rigid, grinning facial expression) before death occurs from asphyxiation.

## Introduction: The Philosopher's End
In 399 BC, **Socrates** was sentenced to death for "corrupting the youth" of Athens.
His method of execution was to drink a cup of **Poison Hemlock** (*Conium maculatum*).
His student Plato recorded the death.
It wasn't violent like Strychnine. It was a cold creep.

## 1. Coniine
Hemlock contains **Coniine**.
It is a neurotoxin that blocks the neuromuscular junction (like Curare).
It causes **Ascending Paralysis**.
First, your feet go numb. Then your legs. Since you can't feel them, you fall over.
The numbness creeps up your body.
Your mind stays perfectly clear. You are trapped in a dead body.
Finally, it reaches your diaphragm. You can't breathe. You suffocate.

## 2. Accidental Death
Today, people still die from Hemlock because it looks like:
*   Wild Carrots (Queen Anne's Lace).
*   Wild Parsley.
*   Parsnips.
The rule of thumb for foragers: If the stem has purple spots ("The Blood of Socrates"), **Do Not Eat It**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Poison Hemlock** is a highly toxic plant containing the alkaloid **Coniine**. It causes death by respiratory failure through ascending paralysis (starting from the legs and moving up), while leaving the victim's mind conscious until the end. It is historically famous as the poison used to execute the Greek philosopher **Socrates**.

        description: "It is an oil, not a gas. A single drop on your skin will kill you. It was designed for war, but famously used in a bizarre assassination in an airport.",

## Introduction: Venomous Agent X
**VX** is the most toxic nerve agent ever synthesized.
It is amber-colored and oily (like motor oil).
It doesn't evaporate easily, which makes it an "Area Denial Weapon." If you spray it on the ground, it stays deadly for weeks.
10 milligrams (a tiny drop) on the skin is fatal.

## 1. The Mechanism
Your nerves send signals to muscles using a chemical called **Acetylcholine**.
Once the muscle moves, an enzyme called **Acetylcholinesterase** cleans up the chemical to stop the signal.
VX destroys the cleanup crew.
The signal gets stuck "On."
Your muscles contract violently and never relax. You die from asphyxiation because your diaphragm is frozen tight.

## 2. The Airport Assassination
In 2017, **Kim Jong-nam** (half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un) was walking through Kuala Lumpur Airport.
Two women approached him. One smeared a cream on his face. The other smeared a different liquid.
They had used a **Binary Weapon**.
The two liquids were harmless separately. But when they mixed on his face, they created VX.
He died in the ambulance 20 minutes later.
It was a chemical warfare attack in a crowded public terminal.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **VX** (Venomous Agent X) is an extremely potent synthetic nerve agent. It functions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, causing total paralysis and death by asphyxiation. It is classified as a Weapon of Mass Destruction by the UN. Its most high-profile use was the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia.

## Introduction: The Safety Expert
**Karen Wetterhahn** was a professor of chemistry at Dartmouth.
She was studying heavy metals.
On August 14, 1996, she was transferring **Dimethylmercury** (a liquid organic mercury compound) using a pipette.
One tiny drop fell on her latex glove.
She didn't panic. She followed protocol: washed her hands, changed gloves.
She didn't know that latex provides **zero protection** against this specific chemical.

## 1. The Permeability
Dimethylmercury is lipophilic (fat-loving).
It passed through the latex glove in **15 seconds**.
It passed through her skin instantly.
She felt nothing.

## 2. Six Months Later
In January 1997, she started slurring her words. She tripped while walking.
Doctors found her blood mercury level was **4,000 micrograms per liter** (800 times the lethal limit).
Her brain was being eaten away (Minamata Disease).
She went into a coma and died in June 1997.

## 3. The Legacy
Her death changed safety protocols worldwide.
Scientists now use "Silver Shield" laminate gloves instead of latex.
It was a terrifying reminder that even experts can be killed by what they don't know.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dimethylmercury** is an extremely potent neurotoxin. It is particularly dangerous because it can penetrate standard latex gloves and human skin in seconds without causing immediate pain. The death of chemist **Karen Wetterhahn** in 1997 revealed that standard safety equipment was insufficient, leading to a global overhaul of laboratory safety standards.

## Introduction: Beautiful Lady
**Atropa belladonna** (Deadly Nightshade) is one of the most toxic plants in the Eastern Hemisphere.
So why is it called "Bella Donna" (Beautiful Lady)?
In Renaissance Venice, women used drops of it in their eyes.
It dilated their pupils, making them look doe-eyed and seductive.
(It also blurred their vision and increased their heart rate, but beauty is pain).

## 1. Atropine
The active ingredient is **Atropine**.
It blocks the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest).
Symptoms of poisoning are remembered by this rhyme:
*   **Red as a Beet** (Flushing)
*   **Dry as a Bone** (No sweat/saliva)
*   **Blind as a Bat** (Dilated pupils)
*   **Mad as a Hatter** (Hallucinations)
*   **Hot as a Hare** (Hyperthermia)

## 2. The Cure for Poison
Ironically, Atropine is the **Antidote** for Nerve Agents (like VX).
Nerve agents cause muscles to contract forever (Too much Acetylcholine).
Atropine stops the signal completely.
In the movie *The Rock*, Nicholas Cage injects Atropine into his heart to stop the gas.
It proves that the difference between poison and medicine is the dose.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Belladonna** (Deadly Nightshade) contains **Atropine**, a toxin that blocks the parasympathetic nervous system. Historically used as a cosmetic to dilate pupils (hence "Beautiful Lady"), it causes hallucinations, tachycardia, and death. However, Atropine is also essential in modern medicine as the primary antidote for nerve agent poisoning.
