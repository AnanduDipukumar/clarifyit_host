## Introduction: The Mystery Gas
1938. Roy Plunkett (DuPont) is working on Freon (CFCs).
He has a tank of Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) gas.
He opens the valve. Nothing comes out.
But the tank is heavy. It's not empty.
He saws the tank open.
Inside is a greasy white powder.
The gas had **Polymerized**.
It had turned into Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).
He touched it. It was incredibly slippery.
He tried to burn it. It wouldn't burn.
He tried to dissolve it with acid. It ignored the acid.
He had invented **Teflon**.

## 1. The Carbon-Fluorine Bond
Why is it so slippery?
Carbon and Fluorine form one of the strongest bonds in organic chemistry.
Fluorine is a possessive lover. It holds the electrons so tight that it ignores everything else.
Other molecules (Fat, Water, Dirt) try to stick to it, but the Fluorine pushes them away electronically.
It is the loneliest molecule.
**The Manhattan Project:**
The US needed to separate Uranium isotopes (U-235) to build the bomb.
They used Fluorine gas (UF6).
Fluorine is so corrosive it ate every pipe they used.
General Leslie Groves asked DuPont: "Do you have anything that resists Fluorine?"
DuPont said: "We have this weird white powder."
They coated the pipes in Teflon. The Bomb was built on slippery pipes.

## 2. PFOA (The Dark Water)
Making Teflon requires a helper chemical: **PFOA (C8)**.
It acts as a soap to mix the reactive ingredients.
It does not break down. Ever.
"The Forever Chemical."
DuPont dumped 2.5 million pounds of it into the Ohio River.
It causes kidney cancer and birth defects.
A farmer (Wilbur Tennant) saw his cows dying. He sued.
Rob Bilott (lawyer) fought DuPont for 20 years.
**Result:**
99.7% of all Americans have PFOA in their blood right now.
It is in the rain in Antarctica.
We are all Teflon people.

## 3. Self-Healing Plastics
The future of polymers.
If your phone screen cracks, the polymer chains are broken.
New polymers contain micro-capsules of liquid monomer.
When the screen cracks, the capsule bursts.
The liquid flows into the crack and hardens (Polymerizes) on contact with air.
The screen heals itself in 24 hours.
(Already used in LG phones and Nissan car paint).

### Fact Box
*   **The Gecko:** How does a gecko walk on glass? Van der Waals forces. But Teflon is so slippery that even a Gecko falls off. It is the only surface nature cannot grip.

## Introduction: The Unstable Oil
Ascanio Sobrero invented **Nitroglycerin** in 1847.
He was terrified of it.
"It produces a terrible headache just to smell it."
If you shook the vial, it exploded.
If you dropped it, it exploded.
If you looked at it wrong, it exploded.
It was useless for mining because you couldn't transport it safely.

## 1. The Invention (Diatomaceous Earth)
Alfred Nobel wanted to tame it.
His factory blew up. His younger brother Emil was killed.
Alfred kept going (driven by grief or greed?).
He found that if you mix the oily liquid with **Kieselguhr** (fossilized algae/sand), it turns into a paste.
You can mold the paste into sticks.
You can drop the stick. Hit it with a hammer. Burn it.
It won't explode.
It *only* explodes if you use a **Blasting Cap** (another Nobel invention).
He called it **Dynamite** (Greek *Dunamis* = Power).

## 2. Engineering the World
Dynamite built the modern world.
The Panama Canal. The Hoover Dam. The Transcontinental Railroad.
Before Dynamite, we used Pickaxes.
It allowed us to move mountains.
**The War:**
Nobel thought: "My explosive is so powerful that armies will vanish in a second. Therefore, war will become impossible."
He was wrong. Generals loved it. Hign Explosive shells tore WWI apart.

## 3. The Obituary
1888. Alfred's brother Ludvig died.
A French newspaper thought *Alfred* had died.
They printed the obituary:
**"The Merchant of Death is Dead. Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday."**
Alfred read it. He was horrified.
"Is this how I will be remembered?"
He changed his will.
He left 94% of his fortune to create the **Nobel Prizes**.
Today, we associate his name with "Peace" and "Literature", not "Explosions".
PR campaign of the century.

### Fact Box
*   **Heart Medicine:** In old age, Nobel developed heart disease (Angina). The doctor prescribed him... **Nitroglycerin**. It dilates blood vessels. Nobel refused to take it for weeks because he knew it as a bomb, not a medicine. It saved his life (temporarily).

## Introduction: Pre-Antibiotic Era
Before 1928, a scratch could kill you.
A blister could kill you.
Syphilis and Gonorrhea were death sentences.
Doctors had no weapons against bacteria. They used Arsenic and Mercury (which killed the patient too).

## 1. The Accident
Fleming was studying Staph bacteria.
He went on holiday.
He left the plates unwashed.
He left the window open.
A mold spore (*Penicillium notatum*) from the lab downstairs drifted in.
When he came back, he saw a halo.
Around the mold, the bacteria were dead.
"That's funny," he said.
He named the juice "Penicillin".
**The Failure:**
He couldn't purify it. It was unstable. He gave up and published a paper nobody read.

## 2. Florey and Chain (The Real Heroes)
10 years later (1939). WWII is starting.
Howard Florey and Ernst Chain (Oxford) read Fleming's paper.
They decided to mass produce it.
They turned the lab into a factory. They used bedpans, milk churns, and bathtubs to grow the mold.
**Effectiveness:**
They injected 8 mice with deadly Strep.
4 got Penicillin. 4 got nothing.
Next morning: 4 dead mice. 4 live mice.
**Albert Alexander:**
The first human patient. He scratched his face on a rose bush. His eye was swollen shut. He was dying.
They gave him the drug.
He recovered instantly. The "Miracle".
But they ran out of drug. (They collected his urine to recycle it, but it wasn't enough).
He died.
They realized they needed American industrial scale to make enough.

## 3. The Mechanism (The Wall Breaker)
Bacteria have cell walls made of Peptidoglycan.
They constantly rebuild the wall to stay strong.
Penicillin mimics the "Brick" of the wall.
The enzyme that builds the wall grabs the Penicillin instead.
It jams the machinery.
The wall gets weak.
The bacteria explodes from internal pressure (Lysis).
**Resistance:**
Bacteria learned to build an enzyme (Beta-Lactamase) that cuts the Penicillin in half.
Now we have MRSA (Superbugs) that ignore our drugs.
The arms race continues.

### Fact Box
*   **Moldy Contaloupe:** To scale up production, they needed a stronger strain of mold. They searched the world. They found the "Super Mold" on a rotting cantaloupe in a market in Peoria, Illinois. All penicillin in WWII came from that one melon.

## Introduction: The Time Machine
Before 1940, archaeologists guessed dates.
"This pot looks like the other pot, so maybe 1000 BC?"
It was subjective.
Willard Libby (Manhattan Project) realized radioactivity is a clock.

## 1. Creating C-14
Cosmic rays hit the atmosphere.
They hit Nitrogen-14.
$N^{14} + n \rightarrow C^{14} + p$.
It turns Nitrogen into Carbon-14.
C-14 is radioactive (unstable).
It mixes with C-12 (Normal Carbon) in CO2.
Plants breathe the CO2. Animals eat the plants.
**You are radioactive.**
As long as you are alive, you eat fresh C-14.
The ratio of C-14 to C-12 in your bones is constant (matches the atmosphere).

## 2. The Decay
When you die, you stop eating.
No new C-14 comes in.
The old C-14 starts to decay back into Nitrogen.
**Half-Life:** 5,730 years.
After 5,730 years, you have 50% left.
After 11,460 years, you have 25% left.
By measuring the *ratio* of C-14 left in a bone, we can calculate exactly when it died.
**Limit:**
After 50,000 years, there is no C-14 left.
For dinosaurs (65 Million years), we use Uranium-Lead dating (Half life 4.5 Billion years).

## 3. The Bomb Spike
In the 1950s, we blew up hundreds of Nukes.
This doubled the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere.
"The Bomb Pulse".
If you verify a bottle of wine claims to be from 1940... but it has high C-14... it is a fake. It was made post-1950.
Forensics use this to identify bodies. "Was this person born before or after the bomb?"

### Fact Box
*   **The Shroud of Turin:** Believers said it was Jesus's burial cloth (Age 2000 years). In 1988, the Vatican allowed C-14 dating. Three labs tested it. Results: 1260-1390 AD. It is a medieval fake. (Controversy survives, claiming the fire in 1532 messed up the carbon, but the science is solid).

## Introduction: Solitaire
1869. 63 elements were known.
It was a mess. Some heavy, some light, some gases, some metals.
Chemists tried to list them by weight. No pattern.
Mendeleev loved Solitaire (Patience card game).
He wrote the elements on cards.
He shuffled them excessively on a long train ride in Russia.
He fell asleep.
**The Dream:**
"I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper."

## 1. The Periodicity
He ordered them by weight... but started a new row when the properties repeated.
Lithium (Reacts with water).
Sodium (Reacts with water).
Potassium (Reacts with water).
They all lined up in column 1 (**Alkali Metals**).
Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine -> Column 7 (**Halogens**).
The universe has a rhythm.

## 2. The Blank Spaces (The Genius)
Other people had made tables.
Mendeleev did something arrogant.
He left holes.
"There should be an element here. It doesn't exist yet. But it will."
He predicted **Eka-Aluminum**:
"It will have weight 68. It will be a shiny metal with low melting point."
4 years later, the French discovered Gallium.
Weight: 69. Shiny metal. Melts in your hand.
He predicted Scandium. Germanium.
He wasn't just organizing nature; he was decoding its logic.

## 3. The Anomaly (Noble Gases)
In 1894, Ramsay discovered Argon.
It didn't fit. It didn't react with anything.
It broke Mendeleev's law.
Did the table fail?
No. Ramsay realized there was a *whole missing column*.
The Noble Gases (Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton).
They slotted in perfectly on the right edge.
The map was complete. (Until Quantum Mechanics explained *why* they don't react - full electron shells).

### Fact Box
*   **Element 101:** We named it **Mendelevium** after him. A higher honor than a Nobel Prize (which he never won, due to politics).
