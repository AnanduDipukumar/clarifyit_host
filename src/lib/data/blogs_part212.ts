## Introduction: The Good King
Osiris was the first Pharoah. He taught humans farming and law.
Everyone loved him.
Except his brother **Set** (Chaos).
Set tricked Osiris into a coffin, sealed it, and threw it in the Nile.
Then he found the body and chopped it into 14 pieces, scattering them across Egypt.

## 1. Resurrection
Osiris's wife, **Isis**, searched the world.
She found 13 pieces (a fish ate the 14th).
She wrapped him in linen (The First Mummy) and used magic to bring him back for one night.
In that night, they conceived a son: **Horus**.

## 2. King of the Underworld
Osiris could not stay in the land of the living (he was incomplete).
So he went down to the **Duat** (Underworld).
He became the Judge of the Dead.
Every Egyptian hoped to become "An Osiris" after death—resurrected and eternal.
The myth promises that Death is not the end.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Osiris** is the Egyptian Lord of the Underworld and Judge of the Dead. His myth—betrayal by his brother Set, dismemberment, and resurrection by his wife Isis—was central to Egyptian religion. It established the rituals of mummification and the hope for an afterlife. He is often depicted with green skin, symbolizing rebirth and vegetation.

## Introduction: The Cycle
For the Egyptians, the sun wasn't a ball of gas. It was a God: **Ra**.
Ra rides his Solar Barque (Boat) across the sky during the day.
He is the King of Gods.
But he gets old every evening.

## 1. The Night Journey
At sunset, Ra dies and enters the Underworld.
This is the dangerous time.
**Apep** (Apophis), the Chaos Serpent, attacks the boat.
He tries to eat the sun.
If he succeeds, the sun will not rise, and the world will end.
Ra, helped by Seth and Bastet, fights the snake every single night.
The Sunrise is the sign of their victory.

## 2. The Eye of Ra
Ra once got angry at humans for mocking his old age.
He sent his "Eye" (Sekhmet) to destroy them.
She almost wiped out humanity (drinking their blood) until Ra tricked her with red beer.
It shows the dual nature of the sun: It gives life, but it can also burn you to death.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ra** was the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun. By the Fifth Dynasty, he became a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun. Egyptians believed that Ra traveled on two solar boats called the Mandjet (Morning Boat) and the Mesektet (Evening Boat). These boats took him on his journey through the sky and the Duat (Underworld).

## Introduction: The Guardian
Before Osiris, Anubis was the King of the Dead.
When Osiris took over, Anubis became the Gatekeeper.
He has the head of a **Jackal** (because jackals were seen digging up graves—Egyptians prayed to Anubis to protect the graves from his own kind).

## 1. The Weighing of the Heart
You die. Anubis leads you to the Hall of Truth.
He takes your **Heart** (the seat of emotion and memory).
He puts it on a scale.
On the other side: The **Feather of Ma'at** (Truth/Order).
If you were wicked, your heart is heavy with sin.
If you were good, your heart is light as air.

## 2. Ammit the Devourer
If the heart is heavy?
Anubis feeds it to **Ammit** (Part Crocodile, Part Lion, Part Hippo).
Your soul is destroyed. You cease to exist.
This was the worst fear of an Egyptian: Erasure.
If the heart balances?
Anubis leads you to Osiris for eternal life.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Anubis** is the Greek name of the god of death, mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries, tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. His most famous role is overseeing the **Weighing of the Heart** ceremony to determine the worthiness of a soul.

## Introduction: The Throne
**Isis** (Aset) means "Throne". She is the personification of the Pharaoh's power.
She is the perfect wife (saving Osiris) and the perfect mother (protecting Horus).
But she is also dangerous.

## 1. The Secret Name
Ra was old and drooling.
Isis took his spit and made a clay snake.
The snake bit Ra.
Ra was in agony. "Heal me!"
Isis said: "I can only heal you if I know your Secret Name."
Names have power. If she knew his true name, she would have power over him.
Ra refused. The pain got worse.
Eventually, he whispered it.
Isis healed him... but now *she* had the power of the King of Gods.
She passed this magic to her son, Horus, so he could defeat Set.

## 2. Legacy
The cult of Isis spread to Rome (where she was worshipped alongside Jesus for centuries).
Statues of Isis holding baby Horus look almost identical to Mary holding Jesus.
She is the archetype of the Divine Mother.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Isis** was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. She was worshipped as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. She was the friend of slaves, sinners, artisans and the downtrodden, but she also listened to the prayers of the wealthy, maidens, aristocrats and rulers.

## Introduction: The User Manual
You died. Now what?
The Underworld (Duat) is a maze filled with demons, fire lakes, and gates guarded by monsters.
You need a map.
The **Book of the Dead** (literally "Book of Coming Forth by Day") is a roll of papyrus buried with you.

## 1. The Spells
It contains spells to:
*   Open your mouth (so you can eat/speak in the afterlife).
*   Don't let my heart betray me (asking your heart not to snitch to Anubis).
*   Transform into a Hawk/Lotus/Snake to escape traps.
*   The Passwords for the Gates. "I know you, Gatekeeper. Your name is..."

## 2. The Negative Confession
When you meet the 42 Judges, you don't say "I was good."
You say "I was NOT bad."
"I have not stolen. I have not killed. I have not stopped water from flowing."
If you have the Book, you have the script.
Even if you *did* steal, the magic of the book might fool the gods.
It was the ultimate insurance policy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Book of the Dead** is an ancient Egyptian funerary text used from the beginning of the New Kingdom (around 1550 BCE) to around 50 BCE. It consists of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the **Duat**, or underworld, and into the afterlife.
