## Introduction: The Seven Sisters
Before 1960, Western oil companies (The Seven Sisters) controlled Middle Eastern oil.
They paid the countries peanuts.
So, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Venezuela formed **OPEC** (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).

## 1. The Weapon
For a decade, nobody cared.
Then came the **1973 Yom Kippur War**.
To punish the West for supporting Israel, OPEC turned off the tap.
The price of oil quadrupled.
Cars lined up for miles. The US economy crashed (Stagflation).
The world realized: OPEC holds the steering wheel.

## 2. The Decline
Today, OPEC is weaker.
Why? **Fracking**. The US became the world's largest oil producer.
But OPEC still controls 80% of reserves. When they speak, the stock market listens.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **OPEC** operates as a legal cartel, coordinating oil production quotas among member nations to manipulate global prices. Their control over supply allows them to influence geopolitical leverage and economic stability worldwide, though the rise of non-OPEC production (like US Shale) has challenged their dominance.

## Introduction: Bretton Woods
In 1944, the Allies met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, NH.
They wanted to prevent another Great Depression (which caused WWII).
They created two sisters:
1.  **The IMF (International Monetary Fund):** The Firefighter. It gives emergency loans to countries going bankrupt.
2.  **The World Bank:** The Builder. It lends money for dams, schools, and roads.

## 1. The Controversy
It sounds nice. But the loans come with conditions (Austerity).
"We will save you, but you must cut spending and sell your national industries."
Critics call it **Neocolonialism**.
Supporters say it prevents hyperinflation.

## 2. The Dollar
Both organizations are traditionally led by Westerners (US & Europe).
They cemented the US Dollar as the global reserve currency.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **IMF** and **World Bank** were established at the Bretton Woods Conference to stabilize the global economy. The IMF focuses on short-term financial stability and crisis management (bailouts), while the World Bank focuses on long-term economic development and poverty reduction in developing nations.

## Introduction: The Panic
Before 1913, the US had no Central Bank.
Every 10 years, banks would panic and collapse.
J.P. Morgan literally saved the country personally in 1907.
Congress decided we needed a system, not a rich guy.

## 1. The Dual Mandate
The Fed has two jobs:
1.  **Keep Prices Stable** (Low Inflation).
2.  **Keep People Employed** (Low Unemployment).
They do this by raising or lowering **Interest Rates**.
Low rates = Easy money (Boom). High rates = Hard money (Recession).

## 2. Quantitative Easing
In 2008 and 2020, the Fed started "Printing Money" (digitally).
They bought trillions of dollars of bonds to keep the economy alive.
It worked, but it terrified people who fear hyperinflation.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Federal Reserve** is the central banking system of the United States. It manages the money supply and interest rates to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. It operates independently of the President, allowing it to make unpopular but necessary economic decisions (like raising rates to fight inflation).

## Introduction: The Hansa
In the 1300s, crossing the sea was dangerous (Pirates).
Merchants in Germany (Lübeck, Hamburg) banded together.
"If you attack one of us, you attack all of us."
They formed the **Hanseatic League**.

## 1. Monopoly
They controlled the trade of salt, fish, timber, and fur.
They were so powerful they defeated the King of Denmark in war.
They had their own laws, their own army, and their own flag.
They were arguably the first multinational corporation.

## 2. The Legacy
They built the beautiful brick gothic cities of Northern Europe.
Lufthansa (the airline) is named after them.
They proved that trade creates power faster than conquest.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Hanseatic League** was a powerful commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in Northwestern and Central Europe. Dominated by German cities like Lübeck, it controlled maritime trade in the Baltic and North Seas for three centuries, effectively operating as a superpower without a king.

## Introduction: The Rivals
You know the Knights Templar (Bankers).
Included are their rivals: The **Knights Hospitaller** (Doctors).
During the Crusades, they ran hospitals.
When the Holy Land fell, they retreated to the island of **Rhodes**, then **Malta**.

## 1. The Corsairs
On Malta, they built a mighty navy.
They became state-sponsored pirates (Privateers), raiding Ottoman ships.
They grew incredibly rich, effectively running a protection racket in the Mediterranean.

## 2. Sovereign Entity
Napoleon kicked them out of Malta in 1798.
But they never dissolved.
Today, the **Sovereign Military Order of Malta** is recognized by the UN.
They issue their own passports, stamps, and currency.
They have embassies around the world.
But they have zero territory. They are a government in exile, running hospitals once again.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Knights Hospitaller** (Order of Malta) began as a medical order in Jerusalem. Unlike the Templars who were disbanded, the Hospitallers survived by transforming into a naval power on Rhodes and Malta. Today, they remain a unique subject of international law: a sovereign entity without territory, maintaining diplomatic relations with over 100 countries.
