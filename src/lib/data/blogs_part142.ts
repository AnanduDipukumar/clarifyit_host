## Introduction: God
"Not even God himself could sink this ship."
When you challenge nature, nature answers.
Titanic was the largest object ever moved by man.
It was designed to be a ferry for the rich (First Class) and a cattle car for the poor (Steerage).
It was built on **Hubris**.
They cut the number of lifeboats from 48 to 20 because "it cluttered the deck".
That aesthetic choice sentenced 1,500 people to death.

## 1. The Critical Mistake (Murdoch's Turn)
April 14, 1912. 11:40 PM.
The lookouts didn't have binoculars (locked in a locker, key was lost).
They saw the berg late.
First Officer Murdoch ordered: **"Hard a-starboard. Full astern."**
He tried to swerve around it.
**This was the fatal error.**
If he had rammed the iceberg head-on, the ship would have crumpled the bow. It would have looked ugly. But it would have floated.
By swerving, he exposed the weak side of the hull. The ice acted like a can opener, slicing open 5 watertight compartments.
The ship could float with 4. Not 5.

## 2. The Californian Mystery
While the Titanic was sinking, another ship, the **SS Californian**, was only 10 miles away.
They saw the flares.
But their radio operator had gone to sleep.
The Captain looked at the flares and said: "Maybe they are having a party?"
If they had responded, they could have saved everyone.
Instead, the **Carpathia** (58 miles away) had to race through the ice field, arriving 2 hours too late.

## 3. The Band
The legend is true.
Wallace Hartley and his band played on the deck while the ship slanted.
Why? To stop a panic.
If 2,200 people rushed the 20 boats, no one would survive.
They played "Nearer, My God, to Thee" as the water washed over their shoes.
They all died.
It remains the ultimate act of professional stoicism.

> Disasters are rarely one thing.
> They are a stack of Swiss Cheese slices.
> 1. No Binoculars.
> 2. Speeding (22 knots).
> 3. Calm water (No breaking waves against the berg).
> 4. The Turning Maneuver.
> 5. Not enough boats.
> The holes aligned.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Titanic** sank not just because of an iceberg, but because of a cascade of human errors. The removal of lifeboats for aesthetics, the lack of binoculars, and the decision to turn the ship (exposing the flank) rather than ramming head-on sealed its fate. The tragedy ended the "Edwardian Optimism" era and led to the strict maritime safety laws (SOLAS) that govern travel today.

## Introduction: The Test
April 26, 1986.
The engineers at Chernobyl Reactor 4 were running a safety test.
To do it, they had to disable the safety systems.
The reactor became unstable (Xenon poisoning).
They tried to shut it down.
They pressed the Emergency Button: **AZ-5**.
It should have inserted all headers to kill the reaction.
Instead, it made the reactor explode.
Why?

## 1. The Design Flaw (RBMK)
The RBMK reactor had a secret flaw.
The Control Rods (brakes) were made of Boron. Boron stops neutrons.
**But the TIPS of the rods were made of Graphite.**
Graphite *accelerates* neutrons.
Why? It was cheaper.
When they pressed AZ-5, the Graphite tips entered the core first.
For a split second, power didn't go down. It went UP.
It spiked to 30,000 MW.
The water turned to steam instantly. The lid (1,000 tons) blew off. The core was exposed to air.

## 2. The Liquidators (Bio-Robots)
The USSR couldn't use robots to clean the roof. The radiation fried the circuits.
So they used men.
"Bio-Robots".
3,828 men ran onto the roof for 90 seconds huge shovels.
They threw a shovel of radioactive graphite back into the hole. Then ran back.
They absorbed a lifetime of radiation in 90 seconds.
They saved Europe. Most died young.

## 3. The Collapse of the USSR
Mikhail Gorbachev later said: **"Chernobyl was the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union."**
It shattered the illusion of Soviet superiority.
It exposed the lies, the cheap construction, and the disregard for life.
You can't lie to physics.
"Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid."

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Elephant's Foot:** In the basement of the reactor, there is a blob of melted nuclear fuel, concrete, and sand. It is the most toxic object on Earth.
> In 1986, 30 seconds of looking at it would kill you.
> Even today, it is warm. It is slowly eating through the concrete floor. If it hits the groundwater... it poisons the Dnipro river.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Chernobyl** was a catastrophe caused by a fatal design flaw in the **RBMK Reactor** control rods (Graphite tips). When the emergency shutdown (AZ-5) was triggered, it caused a momentary power spike that blew the reactor apart. The disaster forced the Soviet Union to admit its technological failures and relies on the sacrifice of 600,000 **Liquidators** to contain the fallout. It stands as a monument to the danger of prioritizing political image over scientific truth.

## Introduction: The Scribes
Imagine if every website had to be hand-written by a monk.
That was Europe in 1400.
It took a scribe **3 years** to copy one Bible.
A book cost as much as a farm.
The Church controlled knowledge because they controlled the books.
"God says you must pay us." "Show me?" "You can't read, trust us."

## 1. Movable Type
Johannes Gutenberg was a goldsmith.
He realized he could cast individual letters ("Types") out of lead alloy.
e, e, e, e.
Arrange them in a frame. Ink them. Press.
Swap the letters. Press again.
He didn't just invent printing (China did that). He invented **Mass Production**.
He could print 1,000 pages a day.
The cost of information dropped by 99%.

## 2. The Reformation (Viral Content)
In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his **95 Theses** to a door.
A century earlier, the Church would have just burned him.
But Luther used the Press.
He printed pamphlets. (The Tweets of 1500).
They went viral.
Within 2 weeks, all of Germany knew. Within a month, all of Europe.
You couldn't burn the books fast enough.
The Press broke the monopoly on Truth.

## 3. The Scientific Revolution
Before the press, data died with the scientist.
Copernicus could read data from astronomers in Greece.
Newton could read Copernicus.
**Cumulative Knowledge.**
Science requires sharing data. The Press was the server.
Without Gutenberg, we don't have the Moon Landing.

> **Mental Model: Permissionless Innovation**
>
> Before Gutenberg, you needed the Bishop's permission to publish.
> After Gutenberg, anyone with a press could publish.
> Before the Internet, you needed a TV Station's permission.
> Now, anyone can tweet.
> The Press was the first decentralized network.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Johannes Gutenberg's** invention of the movable type printing press in 1450 was the most disruptive technology of the millennium. By collapsing the cost of books, it enabled the **Protestant Reformation** (by allowing people to read the Bible themselves) and the **Scientific Revolution** (by allowing data to spread). It transformed Europe from an illiterate feudal society into an information age civilization.

## Introduction: The Rivals
In 1903, the smart money was on **Samuel Langley**.
He was the Secretary of the Smithsonian.
He had $50,000 in government grants.
He built a massive machine with a huge engine.
It crashed into the Potomac River immediately.
He thought the secret to flight was **Power**.
He was wrong.

## 1. The Bicycle Insight
Orville and Wilbur Wright were bicycle mechanics.
They knew something Langley didn't: **Unstable Equilibrium.**
A bike is unstable. You have to balance it.
They realized a plane isn't a boat (stable). It's a bike with wings.
The secret wasn't Power. It was **Control**.
They invented **Wing Warping** (Ailerons).
They spent years gliding (learning to steer) before they ever added an engine.

## 2. The Wind Tunnel
The flight data tables from the 1800s were wrong.
The "Smeaton Coefficient" (air pressure) was off.
So the brothers built a wooden box with a fan in their bike shop.
A Wind Tunnel.
They tested 200 miniature wing shapes.
They rewrote the physics of aerodynamics themselves.

## 3. Kitty Hawk (Dec 17, 1903)
They chose Kitty Hawk, NC for the wind and the sand (soft crashes).
10:35 AM. Orville lay on the wing.
The machine lifted.
12 seconds. 120 feet.
It was shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747.
But it was sustained, controlled flight.
They sent a telegram home: "Success."
The local newspaper ignored it. They thought it was impossible.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Moon:** When Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon in 1969, he carried a piece of fabric and wood from the original 1903 Wright Flyer in his pocket.
> From the sand of Kitty Hawk to the Sea of Tranquility in 66 years. One lifetime.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Wright Brothers** succeeded where well-funded experts failed because they treated flight as a **Control Problem**, not a Power Problem. Using their intuition from bicycles, they invented **Three-Axis Control** (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) and built their own **Wind Tunnel** to correct flawed aerodynamic data. Their first flight on December 17, 1903, marked the dawn of aviation, achieved with less than $2,000 of their own money.

## Introduction: The Red Plague
Smallpox was the grim reaper.
It didn't just kill (30% mortality). It erased you.
It covered your entire body, mouth, and eyes in agonizing, fluid-filled blisters.
If you survived, you were blind and scarred.
It killed Ramses V. It killed Louis XV. It killed 90% of Native Americans.
In the 20th Century alone, it killed **300 Million** people.

## 1. The Milkmaid (Jenner's Insight)
1796. Edward Jenner.
milkmaids never got Smallpox. They got **Cowpox** (mild blisters on hands).
Jenner hypothesized: Cowpox protects you.
He took pus from a milkmaid's hand.
He scratched it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy, James Phipps.
Then (unethically), he exposed the boy to Smallpox.
The boy was immune.
**Vaccination** (from *Vacca*, Latin for Cow) was born.

## 2. The Endgame (Ring Vaccination)
In 1967, the WHO launched the Eradication Program.
The strategy: **Ring Vaccination**.
You don't vaccinate everyone on Earth.
You find an outbreak. You vaccinate everyone in that village.
You build a "Ring of Immunity" around the virus.
It has nowhere to go. It dies.
Soviet and American doctors worked together during the Cold War.
The virus was the true enemy.

## 3. The Last Case (Rahima Banu)
1975. Bangladesh.
A 3-year-old girl, **Rahima Banu**, was found with Smallpox.
The world descended on her village.
They vaccinated everyone within 5 miles.
She survived. The virus didn't.
In 1980, the WHO declared: **"Smallpox is Dead."**
It is the only human disease we have ever driven to extinction.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Samples:** The virus still exists in two freezers.
> One at the **CDC** (Atlanta). One at **Vector** (Russia).
> Scientists debate: Should we destroy them to prevent a lab leak? Or keep them to study in case it comes back (Bioweapon)?
> So far, the decision is: Keep them. Just in case.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Smallpox** was one of the deadliest scourges in history until its eradication in 1980. Starting with **Edward Jenner's** discovery of the Cowpox vaccine, humanity waged a global campaign using **Ring Vaccination** to corner the virus. Its elimination stands as the crowning achievement of public health, proving that global cooperation can literally wipe a monster off the face of the Earth.
