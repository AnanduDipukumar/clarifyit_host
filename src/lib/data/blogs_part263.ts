## Introduction: The Stone
On the tiny island of Yap (Micronesia), the currency is limestone discs called **Rai Stones**.
They are too heavy to move.
If you buy a house, you don't move the stone.
Everyone in the village just agrees: "That stone now belongs to you."

## 1. The Lost Stone
One crew was bringing a stone back on a canoe. It sank.
But the crew survived and told the village.
The village elders decided: "The stone is still money. We know it's down there. It still has value."
For generations, people traded ownership of a stone sitting at the bottom of the ocean.

## 2. Bitcoin
This is exactly how **Bitcoin** works.
Bitcoin doesn't exist physically. It is just a public ledger (Blockchain) where everyone agrees who owns what.
The Yapese invented the Distributed Ledger 500 years ago.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Rai Stones** are massive limestone discs used as currency on the island of Yap. Because they are immovable, ownership is transferred orally (a mental ledger) rather than physically. This system demonstrates that money is fundamentally a social construct based on trust and collective memory, pre-dating modern cryptocurrency concepts.

## Introduction: The Beads
**Wampum** are white and purple beads made from Quahog clam shells.
To Native Americans (Iroquois), they were sacred ceremonial belts.
To changing European settlers, they became cash.
They were legal tender in Massachusetts until 1661.

## 1. Hyperinflation
Wampum worked because making beads was hard. It took days to grind one shell by hand. Scarcity was guaranteed.
Then the Dutch arrived with steel drills.
They mass-produced millions of Wampum beads.
The supply exploded. The value crashed.
It was the first American case of hyperinflation.

## 2. Cultural Loss
This destroyed the Native economy.
It taught us: Money must be hard to produce (Proof of Work). If it's easy to make, it's worthless.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Wampum** (shell beads) served as a currency for Native American tribes and early European settlers. Its value was derived from the immense labor required to craft them. When Europeans introduced industrial tools to mass-produce the beads, the currency suffered hyperinflation and collapsed, illustrating the importance of scarcity in monetary systems.

## Introduction: The Dream
Europe wanted to stop fighting wars.
"If we use the same money, we can't bomb each other."
In 1999, the **Euro** was born.
Germany, France, Italy, Greece... all using the same coin.

## 1. The Flaw
A country usually controls its own interest rates.
If Greece is in a recession, it should lower rates (print money) to boost the economy.
If Germany is booming, it should raise rates to stop inflation.
But they share one Central Bank (ECB).
You can't have low rates for Greece and high rates for Germany at the same time.
One size fits nobody.

## 2. The Debt Crisis
This caused the 2010 Eurozone Crisis.
Greece couldn't print its way out of debt. It had to beg Germany for a bailout.
The Euro saved peace, but it cost economic freedom.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Euro** is the single currency shared by 20 European Union member states. While it eliminates exchange rate costs and promotes trade, it creates a structural problem: a **Monetary Union without a Fiscal Union**. Countries gave up the ability to devalue their own currency during a recession, leading to severe imbalances during the 2010 Debt Crisis.

## Introduction: Such Wow
In 2013, Billy Markus wanted to create a crypto that was "ridiculous."
He used the Comic Sans font and a picture of a Shiba Inu dog.
He called it **Dogecoin**.
He meant it to be worthless.

## 1. The Community
The internet loved it.
They used it to tip people on Reddit.
They raised $30,000 to send the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics.
Then Elon Musk started tweeting about it.

## 2. Belief
Bitcoin has a cap (21 million). Gold is scarce.
Dogecoin prints 10,000 coins every minute forever. It is terrible money.
But people agreed it had value.
It proves that **Value is Belief**. If enough people believe a joke is worth money, it is.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dogecoin** was created as a satirical cryptocurrency to mock the speculation in the crypto market. Unlike Bitcoin (which is deflationary), Dogecoin is inflationary with an uncapped supply. Despite its lack of technical utility, its massive community and "Meme Value" propelled it to a multi-billion dollar market cap, challenging traditional definitions of value.

## Introduction: Preservation
Today, salt is free. You get packets at McDonald's.
Before refrigerators, salt was the only way to keep meat from rotting.
If you didn't have salt, you starved in winter.
Salt = Life.

## 1. The Via Salaria
Rome built a specific road (Via Salaria) just to transport salt.
Soldiers were given an allowance to buy salt (*Salarium* -> **Salary**).
Wars were fought over salt mines.
In China, the Salt Tax funded the Great Wall.

## 2. Technology Deflation
Geology changed. We found massive salt domes underground.
We invented ice boxes.
Technology took a scarce resource and made it abundant.
It shows that "Value" depends on technology.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Salt** was historically one of the world's most valuable commodities because it was the only method for preserving food. It served as a currency in ancient Rome, China, and Ethiopia. The etymology of "Salary" (Salarium) reflects its crucial role in the economy before modern refrigeration made it cheap and abundant.
