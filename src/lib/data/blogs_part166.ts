## Introduction: The Napkin Sketch
Legend has it Jeff Bezos drew Amazon's strategy on a napkin.
It wasn't a straight line. It was a circle.
**Lower Prices** -> attracts **More Customers** -> attracts **More Sellers** -> increases **Selection** -> improves **Customer Experience** -> drives **Traffic** -> lowers **Cost Structure** -> allows **Lower Prices**.
Repeat.

## 1. Momentum
Jim Collins (Good to Great) coined the "Flywheel".
Imagine a 5,000-pound stone wheel.
Pushing it the first inch is exhausting.
But you keep pushing.
Eventually, the wheel's own weight starts to help you.
Now Amazon is spinning so fast that it crushes competitors just by existing.
Amazon Prime is the grease on the wheel.

## 2. Reducing Friction
Bezos was obsessed with removing "Friction".
*   **1-Click Ordering:** Why type your address every time?
*   **Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA):** Let us store your stuff.
*   **AWS:** Let us host your website.
The goal wasn't "Profit" in the short term. The goal was **Speed**.

## 3. The Doom Loop
The opposite of a Flywheel.
Companies like Yahoo or Sears.
They launch a new strategy. It fails. They fire the CEO. Rename the company. Pivot.
Each stop/start kills momentum.
They push the wheel one way, then the other.
It never moves.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Two-Pizza Rule:** Bezos tried to keep the internal friction low too.
> "If a team can't be fed with two pizzas, it is too big."
> Small teams (6-8 people) move fast.
> Big teams spend all day in meetings talking about meetings.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Flywheel Effect** (Jim Collins) describes a business strategy where every part of the ecosystem feeds the next, creating a self-reinforcing loop of momentum. **Amazon** perfected this: Lower prices drive traffic, which attracts sellers, which improves selection, which lowers costs. Unlike a "Doom Loop" of constant pivots, a Flywheel requires massive initial effort but eventually becomes unstoppable and self-sustaining.

## Introduction: The Kodak Moment
In 1975, a Kodak engineer (Steve Sasson) invented the **Digital Camera**.
It was the size of a toaster. To took 0.01 megapixel photos.
He showed it to the executives.
They said: **"That's cute. But don't tell anyone about it."**
Why? Because Kodak made billions selling **Film**.
They buried the future to protect the past.
In 2012, Kodak went bankrupt.

## 1. Sustaining Innovation
Big companies are smart. They listen to their best customers.
Customers say: "We want better film. We want cheaper development."
So the company focuses entirely on **Sustaining Innovation**.
They improve the existing product.
They ignore the weird, crummy new technology at the bottom of the market.
"Digital is low quality. Nobody wants that."

## 2. Disruptive Innovation
The new tech starts cheap and bad.
It appeals to the "Low End" (people who can't afford a real camera).
But it improves **Exponentially** (Moore's Law).
Suddenly, the "crummy toy" becomes better than the professional product.
By the time the Giant realizes... it's too late. They can't pivot fast enough.

## 3. Netflix vs Blockbuster
Blockbuster made **16% of its revenue** from Late Fees ($800M/year).
Netflix had No Late Fees.
Blockbuster *couldn't* copy Netflix without killing their own golden goose.
They were trapped by their own business model.
They had the chance to buy Netflix for $50 Million. They laughed.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Intel's Pivot:** Intel started as a Memory chip company. Japan started making cheaper memory.
> CEO Andy Grove asked: "If we were kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what would he do?"
> "He would get out of Memory."
> Grove said: **"Why don't we just walk out the door, come back in, and do it ourselves?"**
> They switched to Processors (CPUs). They survived.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Innovator's Dilemma** (Clayton Christensen) explains why successful companies fail. They focus on **Sustaining Innovation** (making current products better for current customers) and ignore **Disruptive Innovation** (cheaper, lower-quality alternatives). Because the new tech attacks the bottom of the market first, it seems irrelevant until it rapidly improves and destroys the incumbent. To survive, companies must be willing to cannibalize their own products.

## Introduction: The Shark Tank
Most businesses are in a **Red Ocean**.
Coca-Cola vs Pepsi. Ford vs GM.
They fight for Market Share.
They cut prices. Margins get thin. The water turns red with blood.
**Blue Ocean Strategy** says: Stop fighting. Go where there are no sharks.

## 1. Value Innovation (Cirque du Soleil)
The Circus in the 1980s was dying. (Ringling Bros).
Kids played video games. Animal rights activists hated the elephants.
Did Cirque du Soleil try to be "Ringling Bros but cheaper"? No.
They reinvented the game.
*   **Eliminate:** Animals (Expensive/Controversial). Star Performers (Expensive).
*   **Raise:** Artistic quality. Music. Lighting. Theater.
*   **Create:** A Circus for Adults.
They charged $100 per ticket (Broadway prices).
They had zero competitors. They weren't a Circus. They were Cirque.

## 2. Nintendo Wii
PS3 and Xbox were fighting a Red Ocean war on **Graphics**. "Call of Duty".
Nintendo couldn't compete on power.
So they made the **Wii**.
Underpowered. Blurrier graphics.
But... a Motion Controller.
They targeted **Non-Gamers**. Grandmas. Moms. Bowling parties.
They expanded the market instead of fighting for the slice.

## 3. Tesla
Tesla didn't make a "Better Prius".
The Prius was a "Green Car" (Slow, Ugly, Virtue Signaling).
Tesla made the Roadster.
A Ferrari... that happens to be electric.
They made it **Desirable**.
They targeted the Luxury Performance market, which had no electric options.
Blue Ocean.

> **Yellow Tail Wine:** Most wine brands talk about "Tannins" and "Soil" and "History" (Pretentious).
> Yellow Tail (Australia) realized most people are intimidated by wine.
> They made a "Beer-like" wine. Sweet. Simple.
> No jargon on the bottle. Just a Kangaroo.
> It became the #1 imported wine in America because they stopped competing on "Connoisseurship".

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Blue Ocean Strategy** advises companies to exit **Red Oceans** (saturated markets with fierce competition and low margins) and create **Blue Oceans** (uncontested market space). By applying **Value Innovation**—simultaneously lowering costs (eliminating expensive non-essentials) and increasing value (adding new features)—companies like **Cirque du Soleil** and **Nintendo** created entirely new categories, rendering the competition irrelevant.

## Introduction: The Fax Machine
Imagine being the first person in the world to buy a Fax Machine.
It is a useless plastic box. You can't send anything to anyone. Value = 0.
Then your friend buys one. Now it has value.
Then 1,000 people buy one. Now it is essential business equipment.
**The product gets better *because* other people use it.**
This is a **Network Effect**.

## 1. Metcalfe's Law
Bob Metcalfe (inventor of Ethernet) created a formula.
**Value = n²** (Number of users squared).
*   2 users = 4 connections.
*   10 users = 100 connections.
*   100 users = 10,000 connections.
This explains why Tech Monopolies grow exponentially.

## 2. Two-Sided Marketplaces (Chicken and Egg)
Uber. Airbnb. Dating Apps.
You need **Drivers** to get **Riders**. You need **Riders** to get **Drivers**.
This is the "Cold Start Problem".
But once you reach **Critical Mass**... it becomes a fortress.
A new competitor can't just build a better App. They have to steal *everyone* at once.
This is a **Moat**.

## 3. Data Network Effects
Google and TikTok.
It's not just about connecting people. It's about data.
Every time you search on Google, you teach the algorithm what is relevant.
Google gets smarter.
Bing has fewer searches, so it learns slower.
Because Google is smarter, you use Google.
It is a positive feedback loop.
"Content is King, but Distribution is King Kong."

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Doing Things That Don't Scale:** How did Airbnb solve the Cold Start problem?
> They cheated.
> The founders went to New York and personally took professional photos of the first apartments.
> They threw parties. They hand-held the first users.
> You have to push the snowball up the hill before it can roll down.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Network Effects** occur when a product becomes more valuable as more people use it. **Metcalfe's Law** states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its users ($n^2$), leading to exponential growth. This creates powerful defensive **Moats** for companies like Facebook or Uber; competitors cannot displace them just by having better technology—they must also replicate the entire user base.

## Introduction: The Movie Theater
You pay $15 for a movie ticket.
Halfway through, the movie is terrible.
Do you walk out?
Most people stay. "I paid $15. I'm getting my money's worth."
**Rational Logic:** The $15 is gone. Sunk.
You can't get it back.
So your choice is:
A) Lose $15 + Suffer for 2 more hours.
B) Lose $15 + Go home and do something fun.
Sticking with it is *irrational*.

## 1. The Concorde Fallacy
In the 1960s, Britain and France built a Supersonic Jet (The Concorde).
Mid-way through construction, they realized it would never be profitable.
It guzzled fuel. It was too loud (Sonic Booms).
But they had already spent millions. And national pride was at stake.
So they spent *Billions* more to finish it.
It flew for 27 years and never made a profit.
They threw good money after bad.

## 2. Opportunity Cost
The real cost of a "Zombie Project" isn't just the money you waste.
It is the **Opportunity Cost**.
Every engineer working on the dead project is an engineer *not* working on the next breakthrough.
You are paying a double tax.
Winners quit fast. Losers persist out of pride.

## 3. Relationships and War
This applies to life.
"We've been dating for 5 years, I can't break up now." (Even if you are miserable).
"We can't pull the troops out now, the soldiers who died will have died in vain."
That is the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
More death doesn't retroactive give meaning to past death.
Decisions should be based on **Future Value**, not **Past Cost**.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Stewart Butterfield:** He raised millions to make a Video Game called **Glitch**.
> The game was failing.
> He realized it wasn't working. He decided to shut it down and return the money to investors.
> But... his team had built a little internal chat tool to talk to each other.
> He thought: "Maybe we can sell the chat tool?"
> He pivoted.
> that tool became **Slack**. It sold for **$27 Billion**.
> Quitting the game saved the company.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** (Concorde Fallacy) is the cognitive bias where we continue an endeavor because of previously invested resources (money, time, effort), rather than current cost-benefit analysis. Whether in business projects, bad investments, or wars, rational decision-making ignores **Sunk Costs** (which are unrecoverable) and focuses solely on **Future Outcomes** and **Opportunity Costs**.
