## Introduction: The Warm Lake
**Naegleria fowleri** is a microscopic amoeba.
It lives in warm fresh water (lakes, rivers, hot springs).
It feeds on bacteria.
It generally ignores humans.
But if you dive into a lake and water rushes up your nose...

## 1. The Cribriform Plate
Inside your nose, there is a bony sieve called the **Cribriform Plate**.
The olfactory nerve (smell) passes through it to the brain.
If the amoeba reaches this plate, it realizes: "Food."
It climbs up the nerve directly into the frontal lobe.

## 2. PAM
It causes **Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)**.
The amoeba literally eats your brain cells.
The immune system attacks, causing massive swelling.
But the skull prevents expansion, so the brain is crushed.
Fatality rate: **97%**.
Only 4 people in the US have ever survived it.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Naegleria fowleri** is a free-living amoeba found in warm freshwater environments. While harmless if swallowed, it can be fatal if forced up the nose, where it travels along the olfactory nerve to the brain. It causes a rapid, devastating infection called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), which destroys brain tissue and is almost always fatal.

## Introduction: The Middleman
The **Human Botfly** (*Dermatobia hominis*) is large and loud.
If it landed on you to lay eggs, you would swat it.
So it kidnaps a **Mosquito**.
It catches a mosquito mid-air, glues its eggs to the mosquito's belly, and lets it go.
When the mosquito bites you, your body heat melts the glue.
The eggs hatch, and the larvae fall onto your skin and burrow into the bite hole.

## 1. The Breathing Tube
The larva lives in your subcutaneous tissue.
It eats your flesh.
It keeps a tiny hole open in your skin so it can breathe.
You can see the liquid moving inside the hole as it respires.

## 2. Removal
If you try to pull it out, you fail.
It has backward-facing spines that anchor it like a fishhook.
If you burst it, you get a massive infection.
The trick?
Cover the air hole with bacon fat or petroleum jelly.
The larva suffocates and pokes its head out to breathe. Then you grab it with tweezers.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Human Botfly** uses an intermediate vector (usually a mosquito) to deliver its eggs to a human host. The larvae burrow into the skin, causing myiasis (infestation). Anchored by recurved spines, the larva maintains a breathing pore in the skin surface, growing for weeks before emerging to pupate.

        description: "It looks like an alien straight out of a horror movie. It has no jaw, only a suction cup filled with teeth. It has been sucking blood for 360 million years.",

## Introduction: The Jawless
The **Sea Lamprey** is a living fossil.
It evolved before dinosaurs. Before trees. Even before *jaws*.
It looks like an eel, but it has no bones (only cartilage).
Its face is a nightmare: a round suction disc filled with concentric rows of razor-sharp teeth.

## 1. The Attack
It attaches to a fish (like a Trout or Salmon).
The tongue acts like a drill (it has teeth too) to rasp away the scales and skin.
It secretes an anticoagulant to keep the blood flowing.
It drains the host's body fluids until the fish dies or detaches weak and scarred.

## 2. Great Lakes Invasion
In the 20th century, Lampreys invaded the Great Lakes via shipping canals.
They decimated the trout population.
Scientists had to wage a chemical war (using a lampricide called TFM) to save the ecosystem.

## 3. A Royal Meal
Ironically, humans eat them.
In medieval Europe, Lamprey pie was a delicacy.
King **Henry I of England** famously died in 1135 from "a surfeit of lampreys" (he ate too many against his doctor's orders).

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Sea Lamprey** is a jawless parasitic fish that attaches to other fish using a suction-cup mouth lined with teeth. It rasps through the host's skin to feed on blood and body fluids. An invasive species in the Great Lakes, it caused an ecological collapse in the mid-20th century before being controlled.

        description: "It is real-life body horror. This parasite doesn't just eat the host. It rewrites their DNA, castrates them, and forces them to raise its babies.",

## Introduction: The Injection
**Sacculina carcini** is a barnacle.
But it doesn't look like one.
The larval female finds a crab. She crawls over the shell until she finds a soft joint.
Then she sheds her own shell, legs, and eyes.
She becomes a microscopic blob of cells and injects herself *inside* the crab.

## 1. The Roots
Once inside, she grows roots (called an externa) that spread through the crab's entire body.
She digests the crab's organs to feed herself.
Eventually, she bursts a yellow sac out of the crab's abdomen (where the crab's own eggs would be).

## 2. Calculated Cruelty
The crab stops molting. It stops growing.
It is now a zombie.
If the crab is female, it grooms the parasitic sac thinking it is her own babies.
If the crab is **male**, the parasite alters its hormones to feminize it.
The male crab widens its abdomen and begins acting like a mother, protecting the parasite's eggs.
It is total biological hijacking.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Sacculina** is a parasitic barnacle that infects crabs. It invades the host's body as a mass of root-like tendrils, absorbing nutrients and sterilizing the host. It chemically alters male crabs to physically and behaviorally resemble females, forcing them to groom and protect the parasite's external egg sac as if it were their own brood.

## Introduction: The Sting
The **Emerald Jewel Wasp** (*Ampulex compressa*) is small and shiny green.
She hunts Cockroaches (which are much bigger than her).
She attacks from above.
**Sting 1:** In the roach's chest. This paralyzes the front legs for a few minutes.
**Sting 2:** The Precision Strike. She stings directly into the roach's **brain**.

## 1. The Surgery
The venom blocks the neurotransmitter **Octopamine** (which controls motivation to walk).
The roach can still move. It just *doesn't want to*.
It enters a hypokinetic state. It stands there, cleaning its antennae, while the wasp prepares its grave.

## 2. The Walk
The wasp bites one of the roach's antennae and drinks some hemolymph (blood).
Then she leads the roach by the antenna like a dog on a leash.
The roach follows obediently into the burrow.
She lays an egg on it and seals the tomb.

## 3. The Feast
The larva hatches and bores into the roach.
It eats the roach alive from the inside out.
Crucially, it eats the specialized organs last to keep the meat fresh for as long as possible.
After 8 days, the adult wasp bursts out of the roach's empty chest.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Emerald Jewel Wasp** is a parasitoid wasp that reproduces by enslaving cockroaches. It delivers a precise sting to the roach's brain, blocking specific neurotransmitters to eliminate the flight response without causing paralysis. This allows the wasp to lead the zombie-like roach into a burrow, where it serves as fresh, living food for the wasp's larva.
