## Introduction: Semper Augustus
The Dutch Golden Age.
Tulips were exotic (from Turkey).
A virus (Mosaic Virus) gave them beautiful stripes.
Everyone wanted one.
Prices rose.
People sold their land, cows, and houses to buy bulbs.
"It can only go up!"

## 1. The Crash (Feb 1637)
At an auction in Haarlem, a buyer didn't show up.
Panic spreads.
"If nobody buys... the price is zero."
Within a week, the price dropped 99%.
People were holding rotting onions that cost a fortune.
Bankruptcies everywhere.
It was the first recorded **Speculative Bubble**.

## 2. Crypto Parallels
Bitcoin. NFTs. GameStop.
Human nature doesn't change.
1.  **Displacement:** New tech arrives.
2.  **Boom:** Early adopters get rich.
3.  **Euphoria:** Everyone buys (FOMO).
4.  **Profit Taking:** Smart money leaves.
5.  **Panic:** Crash.
Tulips were the first "To the Moon".

## 3. Was it real?
Historians now think the crash was exaggerated by Calvinists (who hated greed).
Most people didn't actually go bankrupt.
But as a parable? It is perfect.
The value of a thing is only what someone else will pay for it (Greater Fool Theory).
If there are no greater fools left... you lose.

### Fact Box
*   **The Black Tulip:** Growers tried for centuries to breed a purely black tulip. They failed. The closest is "Queen of Night" (very dark purple). A pure black flower would absorb too much heat and cook itself.

## Introduction: Taking the Zeroes Off
2008. Zimbabwe.
Inflation rate: 79,600,000,000% per month.
Prices doubled every 24 hours.
If you bought a coffee, you paid *before* you drank it, because by the time you finished, the price would go up.

## 1. The Cause (Mugabe)
Robert Mugabe seized white-owned farms.
Production collapsed.
The Gov needed money to pay soldiers.
They had no tax revenue.
So they printed money.
**Quantity Theory of Money:** MV = PQ.
If you increase Money Supply (M) without increasing Production (Q)... Prices (P) must go up.

## 2. The Result
Paper money became trash.
People used it as toilet paper (it was cheaper than real toilet paper).
They printed a **100 Trillion Dollar Note**.
It wasn't enough to buy a bus ticket.
Eventually, they abandoned the currency and used US Dollars.

## 3. Germany (Weimar Republic)
1923.
Same story.
People brought wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread.
Thieves stole the wheelbarrow and left the cash.
The chaos led to the rise of Hitler.
Hyperinflation destroys trust in society.

### Fact Box
*   **Hungarian Pengő:** The worst inflation ever. 1946. Prices doubled every 15 hours. They printed a 100 Quintillion Pengő note ($10^{20}$). They eventually swept the money into the sewers.

        description: "A controversial theory says governments can print infinite money as long as they control inflation with taxes. Is it genius or insanity?",

## Introduction: Household vs State
You have a budget. If you spend more than you earn, you go broke.
MMT says: The Government is *not* a household.
You are a Currency **User**.
The Gov is a Currency **Issuer**.
It can never run out of dollars. It can just type numbers into a computer.

## 1. The Constraint
The constraint is not Money. It is **Resources**.
If the Gov prints $1 Trillion to build bridges...
And there is plenty of steel and concrete... it's fine.
But if there is a shortage of steel... buying it will drive up the price.
**Inflation** is the only limit.

## 2. Taxes
Why pay taxes if they can just print money?
MMT says: Taxes aren't for revenue.
Taxes are to:
1.  **Delete Money:** To stop inflation (cool down the economy).
2.  **Drive Demand:** You *must* use Dollars because you need them to pay tax to stay out of jail.

## 3. The Danger
Critics say: "Politicians will print money to buy votes, but they will never have the guts to raise taxes to stop inflation."
Historically, every time a gov prints money to cover debts... it ends badly (Rome, Zimbabwe).
MMT is currently being tested (Stimulus Checks). The resulting inflation supports the critics.

### Fact Box
*   **The Trillion Dollar Coin:** In 2011, the US hit the Debt Ceiling. MMT economists suggested: "Just mint a Platinum coin, stamp '$1 Trillion' on it, and deposit it at the Fed." Legally, the Treasury can mint platinum coins of any value. It exposes the absurdity of fiat money.

## Introduction: Automation
AI will replace truck drivers, accountants, paralegals.
Unemployment could hit 50%.
Solution: **UBI**.
Every citizen gets $1000/month. No questions asked.

## 1. The Argument For
*   **Safety Net:** No poverty. No hunger.
*   **Creativity:** If you don't have to work at McDonald's to survive, you can write a novel, start a band, or code a game.
*   **Efficiency:** It replaces complex welfare systems (Food stamps, housing assistance) with a simple check. Less bureaucracy.

## 2. The Argument Against
*   **Cost:** In the US, $1000/month = $3 Trillion/year. That is the entire tax revenue.
*   **Laziness:** "If people get free money, they will play video games all day."
*   **Inflation:** If everyone has more money, landlords will just raise rent by $1000.

## 3. The Experiments
Alaska (Oil Dividend). Everyone gets ~$1500/year. It works well.
Finland (2017). Gave unemployed people €560/month.
Result: They were happier and less stressed. But they didn't find jobs faster.
It improved mental health, not employment.
With AI looming, UBI might move from "Socialist Dream" to "Capitalist Necessity" to keep the economy moving.

### Fact Box
*   **Milton Friedman:** The godfather of Free Market Capitalism supported UBI (Negative Income Tax). He thought it was better to give poor people cash and let them choose how to spend it, rather than the Gov deciding what food they can buy.

## Introduction: Bretton Woods
After WWII, the world agreed:
All currencies are pegged to the US Dollar.
The US Dollar is pegged to Gold ($35/oz).
Stability.

## 1. The French Raid
1960s. The US spent too much (Vietnam War, Welfare).
Printed too many dollars.
France (De Gaulle) noticed: "You don't have enough gold to back this."
France sent battleships to New York to redeem their dollars for Gold.
Other countries followed.
The US Gold reserve was draining.

## 2. August 15, 1971
Richard Nixon went on TV.
He "temporarily" suspended the convertibility of the Dollar into Gold.
It wasn't temporary.
The **Fiat Era** began.
Currencies float against each other.
Money has value only because the Gov says it does (Fiat = "Let it be done").

## 3. The Consequences
Inflation exploded in the 70s.
Debts exploded.
Financialization (Wall Street) took over.
Without the discipline of Gold, governments can spend infinitely.
Goldbugs say this will end in collapse. Keyenesians say it allows flexibility to fight recessions.

### Fact Box
*   **Fort Knox:** Does it still have the gold? Conspiracy theorists say it's empty. The last full audit was in 1953. The Gov says nobody is allowed inside for "Security".
