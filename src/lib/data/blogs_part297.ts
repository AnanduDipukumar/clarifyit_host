## Introduction: The Lottery
If I give you a lottery ticket, you might sell it to me for $1.
If I let you *choose* your own numbers, you will charge me $2 or $3.
Mathematically, the odds are identical (random).
But psychologically, choosing the numbers makes you feel like you are "doing something" to influence the outcome.

## 1. The Dice Test
In casinos, when people want a high number, they throw the dice hard.
When they want a low number, they roll the dice gently.
This is the **Illusion of Control**.
It is the tendency to overestimate our influence over external events.
It explains stock picking (thinking you can beat the market), sports superstitions (wearing lucky socks), and the entire gambling industry.

## 2. Why?
It is a buffer against anxiety.
Admitting that the world is random and chaotic is terrifying.
Believing we have control (even if it's fake) encourages us to take action rather than falling into **Learned Helplessness**.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Illusion of Control** is a cognitive bias where people overestimate their ability to control events that are demonstrably random. First identified by psychologist Ellen Langer, it explains behaviors like blowing on dice, pressing elevator buttons that don't work (Placebo Buttons), and the gambler's belief that "skill" can influence a slot machine. It serves an evolutionary function by reducing stress and motivating agency in an unpredictable world.

## Introduction: The Setup
You walk into a clothing store.
The salesperson shows you a suit for $1,000. You balk.
Then they show you a suit for $600.
You buy it.
If they had shown you the $600 suit first, you might have thought it was too expensive.
But compared to the $1,000 suit, it feels cheap.

## 1. Relative Perception
Our brains do not judge value in absolute terms (Vacuum).
We judge value by comparison (Context).
This is the **Contrast Effect**.
Real Estate agents use it: They show you a "Setup House" (ugly and expensive) first.
Then they show you the house they actually want to sell you (pretty and slightly cheaper).
The second house looks amazing primarily because the first one was terrible.

## 2. In Relationships
It affects dating too.
If you go to a party with a friend who is slightly less attractive than you, you appear more attractive than you actually are.
(This is sometimes called the "Wingman Effect").
We are always measuring ourselves against the person standing next to us.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Contrast Effect** is a cognitive bias where the perception of a stimulus is altered by the simultaneous or recent exposure to a similar stimulus of greater or lesser intensity. In marketing, high-priced "Anchors" are used to make subsequent options appear like bargains. In perception, a gray square looks white against a black background and black against a white background. Context determines reality.

## Introduction: The Parade
In the 1800s, politicians would hire a band to play music on a wagon.
People would follow the music.
Other politicians would "Jump on the Bandwagon" to be seen with the crowd.
Today, it describes the phenomenon where the rate of uptake of beliefs increases as they are adopted by others.

## 1. Social Proof
Evolutionarily, if the whole tribe is running towards the river, you should run towards the river.
Asking "Why?" takes too long.
If you are wrong, you drink water. If you are right, you avoid a lion.
Being a non-conformist is metabolically expensive.

## 2. In Markets
This drives Bubbles.
When Bitcoin goes up, people buy it because other people are buying it (**FOMO**).
In politics, undecided voters often vote for the candidate leading in the polls because they want to "Back a Winner."
It creates a feedback loop (Self-Fulfilling Prophecy).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Bandwagon Effect** is the psychological phenomenon where people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs. It works on the heuristic of **Social Proof** (Safety in Numbers). It is a key driver of fashion trends, stock market bubbles, and huge political swings, overriding individual critical thinking with collective momentum.

## Introduction: Head in the Sand
The myth is that ostriches bury their heads in sand to hide from predators. (They don't).
But humans do.
The **Ostrich Effect** is the cognitive bias where we avoid negative financial or medical information.
We seek monitoring only when we expect good news.

## 1. Selective Attention
If you are overweight, you avoid the scale.
If you are in debt, you avoid opening the bills.
If the market crashes, you delete the Robinhood app.
This is **Selective Attention**.
We treat information as a "Reward/Punishment" rather than "Data."
If the data feels like punishment, we refuse to consume it.

## 2. The Cost
The problem is that avoiding the bill doesn't stop the interest from accumulating.
Avoiding the doctor doesn't cure the cancer.
The Ostrich Effect turns a manageable problem into a catastrophic one because it delays action until it is too late.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Ostrich Effect** is the "avoidance of apparently risky financial information." It explains why investors check their portfolios frequently in bull markets ("monitoring for pleasure") but ignore them in bear markets ("monitoring for pain"). It is a form of **Information Aversion** motivated by the desire to avoid the negative emotional impact of bad news, often leading to suboptimal decision-making.

        description: "When disaster strikes, 70% of people don't run. They don't scream. They just sit there. They are waiting for things to go back to normal.",

## Introduction: The Delay
In the Tenerife Airport Disaster (the deadliest plane crash in history), hundreds of people survived the initial impact.
The plane was on fire.
But they didn't unbuckle their seatbelts.
They sat in their seats until the fire consumed them.
Survivors reported that the passengers seemed "trance-like."

## 1. Denial
This is **Normalcy Bias**.
Our brain has a model of the world where "Everything is Fine."
When a disaster happens (Crash, Tsunami, Shooting), the brain cannot process the new reality. It is too extreme.
So the brain rejects the data.
It tells you: "It's just a loud noise. It's just a drill. Stay in your seat."

## 2. Preparation
This bias is why people refuse to evacuate during hurricanes.
"It won't be that bad. We survived the last one."
The only way to break Normalcy Bias is **Training**.
If you have practiced the drill, your brain has a script to follow ("If Alarm -> Run").
Without a script, the brain defaults to the last known safe state: "Sit and wait."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Normalcy Bias** (Analysis Paralysis) is the tendency of people to underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster. In a crisis, the brain attempts to normalize the situation to reduce anxiety, leading to a delay in evacuation or action. This "freezing response" is estimated to affect 70% of people during sudden catastrophes, distinguishing "survivors" (who act immediately) from "victims" (who wait for confirmation).
