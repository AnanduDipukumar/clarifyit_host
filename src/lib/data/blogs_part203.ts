## Introduction: The Fourth Dimension
We mastered 3D printing. We can print a plastic cube.
But the cube does nothing. It sits there.
**4D Printing** (coined by Skylar Tibbits at MIT) prints objects that *change shape* after they are printed.
The 4th Dimension is **Time**.
You print a flat sheet. You dip it in water. It folds itself into a box.

## 1. Programmable Matter
It works by using "Smart Materials" (Shape Memory Alloys or Hydrogels).
You program the material's reaction to heat, water, or light.
*   **Applications:**
*   **Space:** Print a flat solar panel that unfolds itself in orbit (no complex motors needed).
*   **Medicine:** A stent that is printed small, travels through your veins, and expands when it hits body heat.
*   **Plumbing:** Pipes that expand when water volume increases and contract when it decreases.

## 2. No Assembly Required
IKEA is the nightmare of assembly.
4D Printing is the dream.
Imagine buying a flat box. You open it. The chair assembles itself.
It is the bridge between the digital world (Code) and the physical world (Matter).
We are moving from "Static Manufacturing" to "Active Manufacturing".

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **4D Printing** processes are the same as 3D printing, but with special materials that react to environmental triggers (heat, water, pH). This allows the printed object to change its shape or properties over time (the 4th dimension). It creates "Smart Objects" that can self-assemble or self-repair without human intervention.

## Introduction: Infinite Resources
Earth is finite.
We are running out of Rare Earth Metals (for iPhones) and Platinum (for electronics).
Space is infinite.
A single metallic asteroid (like **16 Psyche**) contains more Platinum, Gold, and Nickel than has ever been mined in human history.
Estimated value: $10,000 Quadrillion.

## 1. The Challenge
Getting there is easy. Getting the ore back is hard.
Rocket fuel is expensive.
You can't just bring the asteroid to Earth (it would kill us).
You have to mine it in Zero-G (robots) and refine it in space.
The goal isn't to bring gold to Earth (that would make gold worthless).
The goal is to build *in space*.
Use the iron to build stations. Use the water for fuel (Hydrogen/Oxygen).

## 2. The Gateway
Asteroid Mining is the gateway to becoming a Multi-Planetary Species.
Once we stop launching materials from Earth's deep gravity well and start sourcing them from the low-gravity belt, the cost of space travel drops by 99%.
The first Trillionaire will not be a software CEO. It will be a Miner.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Asteroid Mining** is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids and other minor planets. Because heavy metals on Earth sank to the core during its formation, the crust is relatively metal-poor. Asteroids offer pure, accessible deposits of Platinum-group metals. It is considered the necessary economic engine for a sustained human presence in space.

## Introduction: Catoms
We have pixels for screens (Picture Elements).
Claytronics wants **Catoms** (Claytronic Atoms).
Tiny, micro-robots that can climb over each other and lock together.
Millions of them acting as a swarm.
They can form any 3D shape, change color, and act as a solid object.

## 1. The Universal Object
If you have Claytronics, you don't need furniture.
You have a lump of matter in your room.
Need a chair? It forms a chair.
Need a bed? It morphs into a bed.
Need to video chat? The matter forms a 3D replica of your friend, mimicking their movement in real-time.
It is the ultimate shape-shifting technology.

## 2. The Tech Hurdles
We are far away.
Current swarms are the size of golf balls.
We need them to be the size of dust.
Powering millions of tiny robots is the main issue.
But if solved, it blurs the line between Hardware and Software.
Physical reality becomes programmable. "Download a Chair."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Claytronics** is an abstract concept for future robotics involving nanoscale robots (Catoms) designed to form **Programmable Matter**. These swarms could dynamically alter their shape, color, and physical properties to mimic any object, effectively creating a real-world, tangible hologram.

## Introduction: Heads Up
We currently look *down* at black rectangles (Phones).
It isolates us.
**Augmented Reality (AR)** puts the data *on top* of the world.
You look at a street, and arrows appear on the pavement showing you the way.
You look at a plant, and a label pops up: "Poison Ivy."
You look at a person... and their LinkedIn profile appears? (The Privacy Nightmare).

## 1. Spatial Computing
Pokemon Go was the demo.
But the future is **AR Glasses**.
When they become light enough to wear all day, screens will disappear.
Why buy a TV? Just project a 100-inch Virtual TV on your wall.
Why buy a monitor? Spawn 5 virtual monitors in the air.
The physical world becomes a canvas for digital information.

## 2. The Mirror World
Kevin Kelly calls this the **Mirror World**.
A 1:1 digital map of the earthOverlaying the real one.
It will change how we learn (fix a car with arrows pointing to the bolt) and how we socialize.
But it also risks the "Black Mirror" scenario: You can "Block" people in real life, turning them into static fuzz.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Augmented Reality (AR)** overlays digital information (images, sound, text) onto the real world. Unlike **Virtual Reality (VR)** which creates a completely artificial environment, AR enhances the user's perception of reality. It is widely considered the next major computing platform after the mobile phone.

## Introduction: Quantified Self
For centuries, we only knew our health when we got sick.
"I feel bad. I go to doctor."
Now, we generate terabytes of data every day.
Heart Rate, HRV, Oxygen, Sleep Stages, Steps.
We are the **Quantified Self**.

## 1. Predictive Health
Your Apple Watch knows you are getting sick before *you* do.
It sees your Resting Heart Rate spike.
It can detect **Atrial Fibrillation** (AFib) and call an ambulance.
It detects falls.
We are moving to a world where the "Annual Checkup" is obsolete because you are being checked up 24/7.

## 2. The Future: Inside
The next step is **Embeddables**.
Smart Contact Lenses (measure glucose in tears).
Smart Tattoos (monitor hydration).
This merges with Transhumanism.
When the computer is *on* you, you are a user.
When the computer is *in* you, you are a Cyborg.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Wearable Technology** refers to smart electronic devices worn on the body. Initially focused on fitness tracking (Steps), they have evolved into medical-grade diagnostic tools capable of monitoring vital signs, sleep quality, and cardiac health. They represent the shift towards **Continuous Health Monitoring** and personalized medicine.
