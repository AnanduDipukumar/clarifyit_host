## Introduction: The Genius
Doug Evans convinced Silicon Valley he was the Steve Jobs of Juice.
He built a machine, **Juicero**, that cold-pressed organic juice packs in your kitchen.
It cost $699 (later dropped to $399).
It had Wi-Fi. It had a scanner to check expiration dates. It had 4 tons of pressing force (enough to lift two Teslas).
Google Ventures invested. Kleiner Perkins invested.

## 1. The Bloomberg Exposé
In April 2017, Bloomberg posted a video.
A reporter took a Juicero bag. He didn't put it in the machine.
He just squeezed it with his hands.
The juice came out faster than the machine.
The internet exploded with laughter.
It became the symbol of Silicon Valley excess: Over-engineering a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

## 2. The Fall
Juicero shut down 6 months later.
It burned through $120 million.
It proved that "Smart" doesn't always mean "Useful."
Sometimes, a hand is the best tool.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Juicero** was a Silicon Valley startup that raised $120 million to sell a high-tech juice press. The company collapsed in 2017 after it was revealed that their proprietary juice packets could be squeezed by hand just as effectively as by the expensive ($400) Wi-Fi-connected machine, becoming a textbook example of unnecessary over-engineering and venture capital hype.

## Introduction: Quick Bites
**Quibi** (Short for "Quick Bites") was pitched as "Netflix for the Commute."
Episodes would be 10 minutes long. High production value (Spielberg, Liam Hemsworth).
You watch it on the subway.
They raised **$1.75 billion** before launching. It was the most hyped startup in Hollywood history.

## 1. The Timing
They launched in **April 2020**.
The entire world went into Lockdown.
Nobody was commuting. Everyone was stuck at home with 65-inch 4K TVs.
Why would you watch a movie on your phone when you are sitting on your couch?

## 2. The Hubris
But it wasn't just bad luck. It was bad design.
Quibi didn't allow you to share clips on social media (Copyright paranoia). So nobody talked about it.
You couldn't cast it to your TV (at launch).
The content was mediocre.
Six months after launch, they shut down.
They lost roughly **$277,000 per hour** of operation.
It is the fastest destruction of capital in media history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Quibi** was a short-form streaming service that raised $1.75 billion to create "quick bite" content for mobile viewing. Launching in April 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic ended commuting, it failed to gain traction due to its mobile-only restriction, lack of social sharing features, and inability to compete with free platforms like TikTok. It shut down after just six months.

## Introduction: Infinite Range
Jet fuel is heavy. Bombers have to land to refuel.
But a teaspoon of Uranium has the energy of a million gallons of gas.
The US Air Force wanted a bomber that could stay in the air for weeks, circling the Soviet Union, waiting for the order.
Project **ANP** (Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion).

## 1. The NB-36H Crusader
They actually built it.
They took a massive B-36 Peacemaker and shoved a 3-megawatt nuclear reactor into the bomb bay.
The pilots sat in a cockpit shielded by **11 tons of lead and rubber**.
It flew 47 times.
The reactor didn't power the engines (yet); it was just a test to see if the radiation would cook the crew.
It didn't (mostly).

## 2. The Crash Problem
The engineering worked. But the logic failed.
If a normal plane crashes, you get a fire.
If a Nuclear Plane crashes, you get a sprawling radioactive disaster zone.
Imagine a flying Chernobyl crashing into London or New York.
Also, ICBMs (Missiles) were invented. Why send a slow plane when you can send a rocket in 30 minutes?
The project was cancelled in 1961.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **NB-36H** was an experimental American aircraft carrying an operational nuclear reactor. Part of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program, it aimed to create a bomber with unlimited range. The program was cancelled because the heavy shielding required made the planes slow, and the environmental risk of a crash (scattering radioactive material) was deemed unacceptably high, especially after the advent of ICBMs.

        title: "Better Isn't Always Winner: VHS vs Betamax",
        description: "Sony's Betamax was technologically superior to VHS. Better picture, better sound, smaller tapes. So why did it die?",

## Introduction: The First Format War
In 1975, Sony released **Betamax**. It was the first home video recorder.
A year later, JVC released **VHS** (Video Home System).
It sparked a war that defined the 80s.
Betamax had higher resolution (250 lines vs 240). It had better color. The tapes were smaller.
It should have won.

## 1. The 1-Hour Limit
Sony engineered Betamax to hold **60 minutes** of footage.
They thought people would use it to record TV shows (sitcoms).
JVC realized people wanted to record **Movies** and **Football Games**.
Movies are 2 hours long.
VHS sacrificed quality to fit 2 hours (and later 4 hours) on a tape.
You could record the Super Bowl on one VHS tape. You needed 4 Betamax tapes.
Convenience killed Quality.

## 2. Licensing
Sony kept Betamax proprietary. They wanted to make all the money.
JVC licensed VHS to everyone (Panasonic, RCA, Hitachi).
Suddenly, VHS players were everywhere and they were cheap.
When the video rental market exploded (Blockbuster), studios had to pick one. They picked the one everyone owned: VHS.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Format War** between **Betamax** and **VHS** is the classic business case study of "Worse is Better." Although Betamax offered superior picture quality, VHS won because of longer recording time (allowing full movies), an open licensing model that drove down player prices, and wider adoption by the video rental industry.

## Introduction: The Genius
Sir Clive Sinclair was the Steve Jobs of Britain.
He invented the pocket calculator and the **ZX Spectrum** (the computer that taught a generation to code).
In 1985, he decided to fix traffic.
His solution: The **Sinclair C5**.

## 1. The Design
It wasn't a car. It was an "Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle."
It was a recumbent tricycle (you lay down).
It was made of white plastic (like a bathtub).
It had a top speed of **15 mph**.
It had **no roof**.
And your head was at the exact height of a car's exhaust pipe.

## 2. The Launch
Sinclair launched it in January. In London. In the freezing cold.
Reviewers drove it on icy roads. The batteries died in the cold. Snow blew in their faces.
Truck drivers said they couldn't see it because it was so low.
It was terrified to drive.
It became the butt of every joke in the UK.
Production stopped after 6 months.

## 3. Ahead of its Time?
People mock it, but today we have E-Bikes and Scooters everywhere.
Sinclair was right about *Micromobility*.
He was just wrong about the implementation. You can't lie down in traffic.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Sinclair C5** (1985) was a small, one-person battery-electric vehicle invented by Sir Clive Sinclair. Marketed as an alternative to cars and bikes, it failed spectacularly due to safety concerns (low visibility to other traffic), exposure to the weather (no roof), short battery range, and poor performance, bankrupting Sinclair Vehicles and becoming a symbol of eccentric British failure.
