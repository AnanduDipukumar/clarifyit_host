## Introduction: The Core
Mercury is weird.
It is tiny (smaller than Titan).
But it is incredibly heavy.
It is basically a giant ball of iron with a thin rock skin.
Collisions likely stripped away its outer layers billions of years ago.

## 1. Hot and Cold
You would endure 430°C (800°F) in the day.
But Mercury has no atmosphere to hold the heat.
So at night, it drops to -180°C (-290°F).
It has the biggest temperature swing in the solar system.
Because the poles are in eternal shadow, there is **Water Ice** hiding in the craters.
Ice next to the Sun.

## 2. The Shrink
As the iron core cools, it contracts.
The planet is literally shrinking.
The crust is wrinkling like a drying raisin, creating "Lobate Scarps" (cliffs) miles high.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Mercury** is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It has a large metallic core relative to its size and virtually no atmosphere. Despite its proximity to the Sun, deep craters at its poles contain **Water Ice** because they are permanently shadowed from sunlight. It orbits the Sun in just 88 days, making it the fastest planet (hence the name Mercury, the messenger god).

## Introduction: Hell
Venus is the hottest planet (465°C). Hotter than Mercury.
The pressure is 90x Earth (like being 1km underwater).
It rains Sulfuric Acid.
Why?
**The Runaway Greenhouse Effect**.

## 1. Carbon Dioxide
Venus has a thick atmosphere of CO2.
It traps heat.
The heat evaporates oceans. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas. It traps more heat.
The cycle spirals until the oceans boil away and the rocks glow.
Venus is what happens when climate change goes terminal.

## 2. Life?
Despite the hellish surface, the upper clouds are mild (20°C).
In 2020, scientists detected **Phosphine** gas in the clouds.
Phosphine is usually made by life (microbes).
Is there floating life in the clouds of Venus? Maybe.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Venus** is Earth's "Evil Twin". It suffers from a **Runaway Greenhouse Effect**, where a thick atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide traps solar heat, raising surface temperatures high enough to melt lead. It serves as a cautionary tale for planetary climate stability. Recent discoveries of phosphine suggest possible microbial life in its temperate upper atmosphere.

## Introduction: Iron Oxide
Why is Mars red?
Rust.
The dust is rich in iron, and it oxidized.
Mars is a cold, desert world.
But dry riverbeds prove water once flowed there.

## 1. The Core Death
Mars is smaller than Earth.
It cooled faster.
When the core solidifed, the magnetic field died.
Without a magnetic shield, the **Solar Wind** stripped away the atmosphere.
 The oceans evaporated into space.
Mars didn't just die; it was murdered by the Sun.

## 2. Olympus Mons
Since Mars has no tectonic plates moving around, volcanoes stay in one spot forever.
**Olympus Mons** grew until it breached the atmosphere.
It is the size of France and 3x taller than Everest.
It is the largest volcano in the solar system.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Mars** is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is a cold, dusty, desert world with a thin atmosphere. Evidence suggests it was once warm and wet, but it lost its magnetic field and atmosphere billions of years ago. It hosts **Olympus Mons** (highest mountain) and **Valles Marineris** (deepest canyon). It is the primary target for human colonization.

## Introduction: The Gap
Bode's Law predicted a planet between Mars and Jupiter.
We looked. We found **Ceres**.
Then Pallas, Vesta, Hygiea.
Thousands of them.
Movies show a dense field where you have to dodge rocks.
In reality, the asteroids are millions of miles apart. You could fly through it blindfolded and never hit anything.

## 1. Jupiter's Gravity
Why didn't they form a planet?
Jupiter.
Jupiter's massive gravity kept stirring the pot.
The rocks couldn't clump together. They just smashed and ground into dust.
If you gathered all the asteroids, they would make a ball smaller than our Moon.

## 2. Mining
The belt is full of Gold, Platinum, and Water.
**Asteroid Mining** could destroy the earthly economy.
A single metal-rich asteroid could be worth Trillions.
This will be the Gold Rush of the 22nd Century.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Asteroid Belt** is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. It contains a multitude of solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The largest is the dwarf planet **Ceres**. Use the belt is sparse; collisions are rare, despite sci-fi depictions.

## Introduction: The Heliosphere
The Sun constantly blows a wind of plasma (Solar Wind).
This creates a bubble around the planets: The **Heliosphere**.
It protects us from deadly interstellar radiation.
But the wind eventually runs out of steam.

## 1. The Bow Shock
Imagine a boat moving through water. It creates a bow wave.
The Sun is moving through the galaxy.
The **Heliopause** is the boundary where the Sun's pressure equals the Galaxy's pressure.
Outside is "Interstellar Space".
It is cold, dark, and radioactive.

## 2. Voyager 1
In 2012, Voyager 1 crossed this line.
Its sensors went crazy. Solar particles dropped to zero. Cosmic rays spiked.
It became the first human object to leave the Solar System.
It is now swimming in the ocean between the stars.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Heliopause** is the theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is considered the outer border of the Solar System. **Voyager 1** and **Voyager 2** are the only spacecraft to have crossed it.
