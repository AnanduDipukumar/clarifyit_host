## Introduction: Intrinsic Value
Gold has value. You can make jewelry.
Rice has value. You can eat it.
A Dollar Bill has no value. You can't eat it. It burns in seconds.
So why do we work for it?
Because the Government says it is money (**Fiat** means "Let it be done" in Latin).
It is backed by "The Full Faith and Credit" of the government.

## 1. Nixon Shock
Until 1971, dollars were receipts for Gold.
You could technically trade $35 for an ounce of gold.
President Nixon ended this (The Nixon Shock).
Since then, money is purely symbolic.
This allows governments to print as much as they want (Stimulus Checks).
But it also risks the currency becoming worthless paper.

## 2. The Network Effect
Money is a hallucination.
But it works because we *all* hallucinate together.
If everyone stops believing in the Dollar tomorrow, it becomes trash.
Money is not wealth; Money is a **Ledger of Trust**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Fiat Money** is a type of currency that is not backed by any commodity such as gold or silver. It is typically designated by the issuing government to be legal tender. Its value is derived entirely from the trust and confidence that the public has in the issuing government's economic stability.

## Introduction: Honest Money
Under the Gold Standard, the government can't print money unless they find more gold.
This prevents Inflation.
It keeps the government honest.
"Sound Money."
So why did we kill it?

## 1. The Deflation Trap
If the economy grows (more people, more businesses), but the Gold supply stays the same, money becomes too scarce.
Prices drop (**Deflation**).
This sounds good, but it destroys economies.
If money gets more valuable tomorrow, nobody spends today.
The economy freezes.
Also, if you have a war/crisis, you can't print money to solve it.
The Great Depression was made worse because countries stuck to Gold.

## 2. Who controls the money?
**Fiat:** The Central Bank (Humans) controls the supply. They can make mistakes (Inflation), but they can also smooth out recessions.
**Gold:** Geology (Rocks) controls the supply. It is stable, but inflexible.
We chose flexibility over stability.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Gold Standard** is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. While it prevents hyperinflation and government overspending, it limits the ability of central banks to use monetary policy (printing money/lowering rates) to fight recessions, often creating severe deflationary spirals.

## Introduction: The Middleman
If I send you $10, how do you know I have it?
We ask the Bank. The Bank has the Ledger.
The Bank is the "Trusted Third Party".
But Banks can freeze accounts. Banks charge fees.
Satoshi Nakamoto asked: "Can we have a Ledger without a Bank?"

## 1. The Blockchain
The **Blockchain** is a Ledger that everyone has a copy of.
If I try to spend money I don't have, your copy of the ledger says "False".
Math (Cryptography) replaces the Bank.
It is **Decentralized Trust**.
"Don't trust me. Trust the Code."

## 2. Digital Gold
Bitcoin is designed to be **Digital Gold**.
There will only ever be 21 Million.
It cannot be inflated by a government.
It is "Hard Money" for the internet age.
Whether it succeeds or fails, the invention of Scarcity in the Digital Realm is a breakthrough.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Cryptocurrency** is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on **Blockchain** technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers rather than a central authority (like a bank).

## Introduction: Purchasing Power
Inflation is not "Prices going up".
Inflation is "Money going down".
If the government prints 10% more dollars, every dollar you own is worth 10% less.
It is a transfer of wealth from Savers to Borrowers (and the Government).

## 1. Is it bad?
Hyperinflation (50%+) is catastrophic.
But *low* inflation (2%) is actually the goal.
Why?
If money slowly loses value, you are forced to Spend or Invest it.
It greases the wheels of capitalism.
If money gained value (Deflation), you would stuff it under your mattress.
The economy would stop.

## 2. Who gets hurt?
The poor.
The rich own Assets (Houses, Stocks). When inflation happens, house prices go up. The rich get richer.
The poor own Cash (Wages). Wages rarely keep up with inflation.
Inflation increases inequality.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Inflation** is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation to a target rate (usually 2%) to keep the economy running smoothly while avoiding the volatility of hyperinflation.

## Introduction: The Death Spiral
Hyperinflation is when a country loses control.
Usually caused by a government printing money to pay war debts (Germany) or buying political support (Venezuela).
Once confidence breaks, it spirals.
Prices rise -> Government prints more to pay workers -> Prices rise faster.
In Germany, prices doubled every 3 days.
People brought wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread. They burned money for heat because it was cheaper than wood.

## 1. The Psychology
It destroys society.
Why work if your wage is worthless by evening?
The middle class is wiped out (Savings become zero).
It often leads to extremism (Hitler rose to power partly because of the economic chaos of the Weimar Republic).

## 2. The Fix
You have to kill the currency.
Germany introduced the Rentenmark (backed by land).
Zimbabwe switched to the US Dollar.
You have to stop the printing press and restore Trust.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hyperinflation** is very high and typically accelerating inflation. It quickly erodes the real value of the local currency, as the prices of all goods increase. This causes the population to minimize their holdings of local money, usually switching to foreign currency. It is almost always caused by a government printing money to finance spending directly.
