## Introduction: The Bard
William Shakespeare (1564-1616).
He never went to University.
He wrote for the "Groundlings" (people standing in the mud for 1 penny).
Yet he captured the entire human experience.
Love, Hate, Power, Madness, Jealousy.
He wrote 37 plays and 154 sonnets that define the English language.

## 1. The Inventor
You speak Shakespeare every day.
If you say:
*   "Break the ice"
*   "Wild goose chase"
*   "Love is blind"
*   "Green-eyed monster"
*   "Heart of gold"
You are quoting him.
He invented over **1,700 words**. (Eyeball, Bedroom, Majestic, Lonely, Gloomy).
When English didn't have a word for what he felt... he made one up.

## 2. Hamlet: The Modern Mind
Before Shakespeare, characters in plays were "Types".
The Hero was brave. The Villain was evil.
**Hamlet** was the first **Modern Human**.
He is a mess.
He overthinks. He is anxious. He is depressed. He procrastinates.
"To be, or not to be."
We see his internal monologue.
Shakespeare invented the concept of the "Inner Self" in fiction.

## 3. Universalism
Why is he played in Japan, India, and Africa?
(Kurosawa's *Throne of Blood* is Macbeth. *The Lion King* is Hamlet).
Because he didn't write about "England".
He wrote about "Power" and "Fathers" and "Ambition".
He removed judgment.
He showed that even a villain like Macbeth has a conscience. Even a hero has a flaw.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Curse of Macbeth:** Actors are superstitious.
> You must never say "Macbeth" inside a theatre (unless performing it).
> You call it **"The Scottish Play"**.
> Legend says the witches' spells in the play are real.
> If you say it, you have to spin around 3 times, spit, and swear to cleanse the curse.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **William Shakespeare** is considered the greatest writer in English because he fundamentally expanded the language (inventing 1,700 words) and the depth of characterization. Through characters like **Hamlet**, he introduced the internal psychological monologue, portraying humans as complex, contradictory beings rather than simple archetypes. His themes are so universal that his stories work in every culture and time period.

## Introduction: The Last Warning
George Orwell wrote *1984* in 1948 (he flipped the digits).
He was dying of Tuberculosis on a remote Scottish island.
He pumped his last energy into this book.
He saw the rise of Stalin and Hitler.
He wanted to show us where it ends.
**A boot stamping on a human face - forever.**

## 1. Newspeak (Linguistic Determinism)
The Party is shrinking the dictionary.
"Bad" is removed. It becomes "Ungood".
"Excellent" becomes "Doubleplusgood".
Why?
**If you don't have a word for "Freedom", you cannot think the concept of Freedom.**
This is the **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis**.
Language controls Thought.
Today: "Collateral Damage" (instead of Dead Civilians). "Enhanced Interrogation" (instead of Torture). Newspeak is real.

## 2. Doublethink
The ability to hold two contradictory beliefs at once and accept both.
**"War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength."**
We do this today.
We protect "Privacy" by spying on everyone.
We fight wars to make "Peace".
The Party demands that you reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.
**2 + 2 = 5**, if the Party says so.

## 3. The Ending
In most dystopian novels (like *Hunger Games*), the hero starts a revolution.
In *1984*, the hero (Winston Smith) is broken.
He is tortured until he betrays his lover.
He sits in a cafe, gin-soaked and lobotomized.
"He loved Big Brother."
It is the most devastating ending in literature.
It tells us: **Resistance is impossible once Totalitarianism wins. We must stop it BEFORE it gets there.**

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Room 101:** The torture chamber contains "The worst thing in the world" specific to the victim.
> For Winston, it was Rats.
> For Orwell... it was also Rats.
> He had a phobia of them from his time fighting in the Spanish Civil War.
> He wrote his own nightmare into the book.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **1984** is a warning about Totalitarianism. Orwell introduced concepts like **Newspeak** (limiting language to limit thought) and **Doublethink** (accepting contradictory lies). The novel demonstrates how a surveillance state (*Big Brother*) can destroy not just the body, but the mind and the concept of objective truth (2+2=5). It ends in total defeat, serving as a bleak plea to protect freedom while we still can.

## Introduction: The Jazz Age (1922)
Stocks were up. Prohibition was failing (Speakeasies).
Everyone was partying.
In Long Island, Jay Gatsby throws the biggest parties of all.
But he doesn't drink. He doesn't dance.
He stands on his dock and stares at a **Green Light** across the water.
He is waiting for Daisy.

## 1. Old Money vs New Money
Fitzgerald dissects the American Class system.
*   **Tom Buchanan (Old Money):** Born rich. Arrogant. Cruel. He has the "Habitus" of power. He breaks things and lets others clean up.
*   **Gatsby (New Money):** A bootlegger. He wears a Pink Suit. He drives a Gold Car. He calls everyone "Old Sport" to fit in.
He tries to buy his way into the aristocracy.
But to Tom, he will always be "Mr. Nobody from Nowhere".
In America, Money is fluid, but Class is rigid.

## 2. The Green Light
The Light at the end of Daisy's dock.
It represents the **American Dream**.
The belief that the Future can be better than the Past.
That if we run faster, stretch our arms further... we can catch it.
Gatsby believes he can "Repeat the Past".
He thinks he can fix his mistakes with money.

## 3. The Tragedy
Gatsby dies alone in his pool.
hundreds came to his parties. No one comes to his funeral (except Nick).
The Dream was a delusion.
"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
We are always rowing toward the Green Light, but the current of our history pushes us back.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Cover Art:** The famous blue cover with the sad eyes in the sky (Celestial Eyes).
> Fitzgerald saw the artwork *before* he finished the book.
> He loved it so much he wrote it into the story.
> The eyes became **Dr. T.J. Eckleburg** (The billboard that watches over the valley of ashes like God).
> "God sees everything."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Great Gatsby** is the definitive critique of the **American Dream**. Jay Gatsby reinvents himself from a poor soldier to a millionaire to win back his love, Daisy. But he cannot overcome the rigidity of Class (**Old Money vs New Money**) or the passage of time. The **Green Light** symbolizes our unreachble desires. The novel suggests that no matter how fast we run, we cannot escape our past.

## Introduction: The Villa Diodati (1816)
"The Year Without a Summer" (A volcano eruption blocked the sun).
A group of poets (Lord Byron, Percy Shelley) and an 18-year-old girl (Mary) are stuck inside a Swiss villa.
They have a Ghost Story contest.
Mary has a waking nightmare.
She sees a "pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together."
She writes **Frankenstein**.

## 1. The Real Monster
The Creature is not the monster.
The Creature is intelligent, articulate, and wants to be loved.
"I am malicious because I am miserable."
**Victor Frankenstein** is the monster.
He is a Coward.
He plays God to create life, but when he sees it is ugly, he abandons it.
It is a story about **Bad Parenting**.
If you create intelligence, you have a duty to care for it.

## 2. The Modern Prometheus
The book's subtitle.
Prometheus was the Greek Titan who stole **Fire** from the Gods and gave it to humans.
Zeus punished him eternally.
Victor steals the "Spark of Life" (Electricity/Science).
He is punished by the destruction of his family.
Science gives us power (Fire), but does it give us wisdom?

## 3. The AI Parable
This story is more relevant today than in 1818.
We are building the Creature right now. **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).**
Will it be a demon?
Only if we treat it like one.
If we build a mind and abuse it, or fear it... it will destroy us.
Frankenstein is the warning label on the 21st Century.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Name:** "Actually, Frankenstein is the Doctor, not the Monster."
> True. The monster has no name. He calls himself "Adam" (The first man).
> But... he is the "Son of Frankenstein".
> So colloquially, calling him Frankenstein sort of works.
> Knowledge is knowing Frankenstein isn't the monster. Wisdom is knowing *Frankenstein* is the monster.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Frankenstein**, written by an 18-year-old **Mary Shelley**, is the first Science Fiction novel. It warns against the hubris of **Playing God** ("The Modern Prometheus"). Victor Frankenstein creates life but abandons it due to its appearance, turning a benevolent creature into a killer. It serves as a timeless allegory for scientific ethics, particularly relevant today in the age of **AI and Genetic Engineering**.

## Introduction: The Ingenious Hidalgo
Spain, 1605.
Alonso Quixano is an old noble who reads too many books about Chivalry (Knights, Dragons, Princesses).
He loses his mind.
He decides *he* is a Knight.
He puts on a rusty suit of armor, takes a skinny horse (Rocinante), and recruits a fat peasant neighbor (Sancho Panza) as his squire.
He rides out to fix the world.

## 1. Idealism vs Realism
The book is a buddy comedy.
**Don Quixote (The Idealist):** Sees a Castle. Sees a Giant. Sees a Golden Helmet.
**Sancho Panza (The Realist):** "Master, that is an Inn. That is a Windmill. That is a Barber's Basin."
Who is right?
Sancho sees the world *as it is*.
Quixote sees the world *as it should be*.
"To surrender dreams - this may be madness."

## 2. Meta-Fiction (Breaking the Wall)
Cervantes was a genius.
He published Part 2 ten years later (1615).
In Part 2, the characters **know they are in a book**.
They meet people who have read Part 1.
They complain about how the author described them.
Cervantes broke the Fourth Wall 400 years before *Deadpool* or *Fleabag*.

## 3. The Tragedy of Sanity
It starts as a satire (making fun of Knight stories).
It ends as a tragedy.
On his deathbed, Quixote wakes up. He becomes sane.
"I was mad, but I am now sane."
Everyone around him cries. They beg him to be the Mad Knight again.
Because a world without Quixote is just... gray.
We need the illusion to survive reality.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Cervantes' Life:** Miguel de Cervantes had a crazy life.
> He was a soldier. He lost the use of his left hand in the Battle of Lepanto.
> He was captured by pirates and held as a slave in Algiers for 5 years.
> He wrote *Don Quixote* while in prison for tax irregularities.
> Suffering created comedy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Don Quixote** is often cited as the first modern novel. It tells the story of an old man who hallucinates himself into being a Knight Errant. It balances **Comedy** (attacking windmills) with deep **Philosophy** (the value of Idealism in a cynical world). Through the interplay of the dreamer (Quixote) and the pragmatist (Sancho Panza), Cervantes explores the blurry line between Sanity and Madness.
