## Introduction: The Stamp
In 1920, Charles Ponzi noticed a loophole.
International Postal Coupons (IRC).
You could buy one in Italy for pennies and trade it in the US for stamps worth dollars.
Arbitrage.
He promised investors huge returns.
People lined up around the block.

## 1. The Structure
The arbitrage was a lie (you would need a Titanic full of coupons).
Instead, he used the money from Customer B to pay Customer A.
Customer A got his 50% profit and told his friends.
Customer C, D, and E joined.
It works perfectly... until you run out of new people.

## 2. The Collapse
When a newspaper (The Boston Post) investigated, investors panicked.
They all asked for their money back at once.
Ponzi didn't have it.
He had $0 in assets and millions in debt.
He spent his chaos years in prison and died poor in Brazil.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Ponzi Scheme** is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. It inevitably collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new participants.

## Introduction: Consistency
The stock market is volatile. Up 10%, Down 5%.
But Bernie Madoff's chart was a straight line up.
10-12% every year. Clockwork.
He claimed he used a "Split-Strike Conversion" strategy.
Actually, he just printed fake statements on an old IBM computer in the basement.

## 1. The Feeders
How did he get $64 Billion?
He used "Feeder Funds" (Wealth management firms) who funneled money to him for a fee.
They didn't ask questions because the returns were too good.
Harry Markopolos (mathematical genius) told the SEC 5 times that Madoff was a fraud.
The SEC ignored him.

## 2. 2008
The Global Financial Crisis hit.
Investors needed cash. They asked to withdraw $7 Billion.
Madoff only had $200 million.
He confessed to his sons.
It was the largest financial fraud in US history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Bernie Madoff** orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, defrauding thousands of investors of over $64 billion dollars. Unlike the typical "Get Rich Quick" scam, Madoff offered steady, modest returns that seemed low-risk, allowing him to operate undetected for decades within the highest circles of Wall Street.

## Introduction: The German Enron
Wirecard was Germany's tech darling.
They processed payments for casinos and porn sites (High Risk).
Then they went mainstream.
They entered the DAX 30 index, kicking out Commerzbank.

## 1. The FT Investigation
Dan McCrum (Financial Times) reported irregularities.
Wirecard sued him. Germany prosecuted *him* for market manipulation.
They hired private investigators to follow him.
But the math didn't add up.
Wirecard claimed they had €1.9 Billion in cash in two banks in the Philippines.

## 2. The End
EY (Auditors) finally called the banks in the Philippines.
The banks said: "Wirecard? Who?"
The documents were photoshopped.
The money never existed.
CEO Markus Braun was arrested.
COO Jan Marsalek fled to Russia (probably a spy).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Wirecard** was a German payment processor and financial services provider. In 2020, it filed for insolvency after revealing that €1.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet did not exist. The scandal exposed massive regulatory failure in Germany (BaFin) and involved espionage, money laundering, and the flight of top executive Jan Marsalek.

## Introduction: 1720
The British Government was in debt.
They created the **South Sea Company**.
The deal: The Company takes the government's debt. In exchange, they get a monopoly on trade with South America (Slaves/Gold).
But Spain owned South America. There was no trade.
The stock price went up anyway. 100 to 1,000 pounds in months.

## 1. The Bubble
Everyone bought it. Lords, Maids, and Scientists.
**Isaac Newton** bought early, sold for a profit.
Then he saw his friends getting rich.
He panicked and bought back in at the peak.
The bubble burst. He lost £20,000 (Millions today).
He famously said: "I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."

## 2. Bubble Act
The crash was so bad it ruined the economy.
Parliament passed the "Bubble Act" banning new companies for 100 years.
It proves that fear of missing out (FOMO) is a human universal.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **South Sea Bubble** (1720) was a financial collapse involving the South Sea Company, a British joint-stock company that was granted a monopoly to trade in South America. Despite little actual trade occurring, speculation drove the stock price to astronomical levels before crashing, ruining thousands of investors and causing a severe economic depression.

## Introduction: Paper Money
France was broke (King Louis XIV spent it all on wars).
John Law arrived. He said: "Gold is stupid. Use paper."
He started a bank (Banque Générale) and the **Mississippi Company**.
He claimed Louisiana was full of gold mountains.
(It was actually a swamp full of alligators).

## 1. The System
He printed paper money to pay the government's debt.
People used the paper money to buy Mississippi shares.
The share price went up -> He printed more money -> Price went up.
He became the richest man in the world.
He was practically the King of France.

## 2. Millionaires
The term "Millionaire" was invented during this bubble.
Servants became rich overnight.
Then, people tried to convert the paper money back to gold.
The vault was empty.
Law had to flee France dressed as a woman to avoid being lynched.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Mississippi Bubble** (1719–1720) was a financial scheme in France engineered by Scottish economist **John Law**. By combining the central bank with a trading company that held a monopoly on the French colonies in North America (Louisiana), Law created a speculative fury funded by printing paper money. When the bubble burst, it destroyed the French economy and set the stage for the French Revolution.
