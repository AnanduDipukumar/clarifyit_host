## Introduction: The Divorce
Imagine a pair of gloves.
You put one in a box and mail it to Mars. You keep the other.
You open your box. It's a **Left** glove.
Instantly, faster than light, you know the glove on Mars is a **Right** glove.
This is distinct from Entanglement, but it's the classical analogy.
In Quantum Mechanics, the glove is neither Left nor Right until you look. It is both.
When you look at yours and it *becomes* Left, the other one *becomes* Right instantly.
They are not two objects. They are one object physically stretched across space.

## 1. The EPR Paradox (1935)
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) wrote a paper saying Quantum Mechanics is incomplete.
"God does not play dice."
They said there must be "Hidden Variables".
(The gloves were always Left/Right, we just didn't know).
**Bell's Inequality (1964):**
John Bell came up with a math test to prove Einstein wrong.
If hidden variables exist, the correlation between measurements should be less than X.
If Quantum Mechanics is true, it should be greater than X.
**The Experiment:**
Alain Aspect (1982) ran the test with photons.
**Result:** Einstein was wrong.
The universe is "Non-Local".
Reality is not defined until observed.

## 2. Faster than Light Communication?
If I flip a switch here, and the particle on Mars flips instantly... can I send a Morse Code message to Mars instantly?
**No.**
Why?
Because the outcome is random (50/50).
I cannot *force* my particle to be "Up". I can only measure it.
If I measure "Up", I know Mars is "Down".
But the guy on Mars just sees a random "Down". He doesn't know *why* it's Down.
To compare notes, I have to call him on a phone (Light speed).
So Relativity is saved. No FTL signaling.

## 3. Quantum Teleportation
We can't teleport matter (Star Trek).
But we can teleport **Information** (The Quantum State).
1.  Alice has particle A (Unknown state).
2.  Alice and Bob share an entangled pair (B and C).
3.  Alice performs a measurement on A and B together. This destroys A's state.
4.  She calls Bob (classical phone) and tells him the result (2 bits).
5.  Bob applies a rotation to C based on the info.
6.  **Magic:** Particle C turns into an exact copy of Particle A.
We have teleported the "Soul" of the particle across the world.
China has done this from Earth to a Satellite (Micius).

### Fact Box
*   **The Monogamy of Entanglement:** A particle can only be fully entangled with one other particle. If A is married to B, it cannot marry C. This property is used for Quantum Cryptography. If an eavesdropper touches the message, the entanglement breaks, and the line goes dead.

## Introduction: The Ghost
Throw a tennis ball at a brick wall.
It bounces back. 100% of the time.
Physics says: If Energy (Ball) < Barrier Height (Wall), transmission = 0.
Schrdinger says: No.
The ball is a wave.
The wave function ($\Psi$) spreads out.
Most of the wave bounces back.
But a tiny "tail" of the wave extends *through* the wall.
There is a non-zero probability the particle appears on the other side.

## 1. Why the Sun Shines
Protons are positive. They repel each other (Coulomb Barrier).
To fuse (Nuclear Fusion), they must touch.
In the Sun's core, the temperature (15 Million K) is **too low**.
The protons are not moving fast enough to overcome the repulsion.
According to classical physics, the Sun should not ignite.
**Tunneling:**
Because there are so many protons colliding, occasionally (1 in $10^{28}$) a proton **tunnels** through the repulsing field and fuses.
This rare event happens enough times to light the solar system.
Without tunneling, the universe would be dark.

## 2. Flash Memory (SSD)
Your USB drive stores data in "Floating Gates".
A trap for electrons surrounded by an insulator.
To erase the data, we apply a voltage.
The electrons **tunnel** through the insulator glass to escape.
**The Limit:**
As we make chips smaller (7nm, 3nm), the walls get thinner.
Electrons start tunneling when we don't want them to (Leakage).
This is why Moore's Law is dying. Quantum mechanics is becoming a nuisance.

## 3. Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)
A needle tip is brought 1 nanometer from a surface.
Voltage is applied.
Electrons tunnel across the air gap.
The current depends exponentially on distance.
If the distance changes by 1 atom diameter, the current drops 10x.
This allows us to feel individual atoms like braille.
IBM used this to spell "IBM" with 35 Xenon atoms in 1989.

### Fact Box
*   **Biochemistry:** Enzymes use tunneling to move protons/electrons faster than classical chemistry allows. Your body is a quantum machine.

## Introduction: The Collapse
In the Copenhagen Interpretation (standard), when you measure a quantum system, the wave function **Collapses** into a single reality.
Where did the other possibilities go? Poof. Gone.
Hugh Everrett (1957) asked: "Why does it collapse?"
The Math doesn't show a collapse. The Schrdinger equation just keeps evolving.
**Many Worlds Theory (MWI):**
There is no collapse.
Everything happens.
The universe **Splits**.
If you measure "Up" or "Down":
*   Universe A: You see "Up".
*   Universe B: You see "Down".
The two versions of "You" can never communicate again.

## 1. The Branching Tree
Every time a quantum event happens (an electron jumps, a photon hits a leaf), the universe bifurcates.
Trillions of times a second.
There are near-infinite copies of you.
*   In one, you are reading this blog.
*   In another, you clicked away.
*   In another, a dinosaur ate your ancestor.
Proponents (Sean Carroll, David Deutsch) say this is the simplest explanation because it takes the math literally without adding a magical "Collapse" rule.

## 2. Quantum Immortality
A grim thought experiment.
Put a gun to your head connected to a quantum trigger (50/50).
**BANG.**
*   Universe A: You die.
*   Universe B: You live.
From your perspective, you can only experience the universe where you are conscious.
So you hear "Click".
Fire again. "Click".
Fire again. "Click".
You survive 50 rounds.
To the outside observer, you died instantly in 99.9% of worlds.
But to **You**, you are immortal.
(Do not try this. You will die in the vast majority of branches, leaving your family grieving).

## 3. The Problem of Probability
If everything happens, what does "50% probability" mean?
If both outcomes occur, isn't it 100%?
Critics say MWI destroys the concept of statistics.
Everrettians argue that the "Weight" of the branches determines the probability.

### Fact Box
*   **Deceit:** Hugh Everrett was ridiculed for this idea. He left physics and worked for the Pentagon calculating nuclear war casualties. He was a chain smoker and drinker. His daughter committed suicide in 1996, leaving a note saying she hoped to meet him in a parallel universe.

## Introduction: Bit vs Qubit
**Bit:** 0 or 1. (Heads or Tails).
**Qubit:** Superposition of 0 and 1. (Spinning Coin).
If you have 2 bits, you have 4 states (00, 01, 10, 11). A computer can be in **one** of them.
If you have 2 Qubits, a computer can be in **all 4** states at once.
**Exponential Power:**
300 Qubits can hold more states than there are atoms in the observable universe ($2^{300}$).

## 1. Superposition and Interference
A Quantum Computer doesn't "try every password".
It sets up a wave pattern.
*   Wrong answers = Destructive Interference (Result cancels out to zero).
*   Right answer = Constructive Interference (Wave amplifies).
When you measure it, the correct answer pops out with high probability.
It is like noise-cancelling headphones for math.

## 2. Shor's Algorithm (The Apocalypse)
RSA Encryption (which protects your credit card and bank) relies on factoring big numbers.
$15 = 3 \times 5$. Easy.
Factor a 2048-bit number? It would take a supercomputer the age of the universe.
**Peter Shor (1994):**
Wrote an algorithm for a Quantum Computer that can do it in **Hours**.
If we build a stable Quantum Computer (4000 logical qubits), all secrets on the internet are broken.
Governments are currently "Harvesting" encrypted data (Store Now, Decrypt Later).

## 3. Sycamore (Quantum Supremacy)
In 2019, Google's **Sycamore** chip (53 Qubits) solved a problem in 200 seconds.
The problem would have taken the Summit Supercomputer (sized of 2 tennis courts) **10,000 years**.
Caveat: The problem was useless (generating random numbers).
But it proved the machine works.
**The Engineering Challenge:**
Qubits are fragile.
Heat, vibration, or a stray wifi signal causes "Decoherence" (The coin stops spinning).
We have to cool them to 0.01 Kelvin (colder than space).
We need "Error Correction" (using 1000 physical qubits to make 1 logical qubit).

### Fact Box
*   **Drug Discovery:** Simulating a Caffeine molecule exactly is impossible for a classical computer (too many electron interactions). A Quantum Computer does it naturally. This will revolutionize medicine by allowing us to design drugs atom-by-atom.

## Introduction: Young's Light
Thomas Young (1801) shone light through two slits.
He saw an **Interference Pattern** (Stripes).
Waves interfere. Particles (bullets) do not.
So Light is a Wave.

## 1. Electron Bullets
1927. Davisson and Germer fired Electrons (particles).
They saw an **Interference Pattern**.
Electrons are waves?
Okay.
**The Single Electron:**
They fired electrons *one at a time*.
Click... Click... Click.
Over time, the pattern built up.
Wait.
If there is only one electron, what is it interfering with? Ideally, itself.
The single electron goes through **Both Slits**, interferes with itself, and decides where to land.

## 2. The Observer
"This is crazy," said the scientists. "Let's put a detector at the slits to see which one it goes through."
They turn on the detector.
*Bleep.* "It went through Slit A."
They look at the back screen.
**The Interference Pattern is GONE.**
It is now two bands (Particle pile).
By looking, we forced the electron to choose a path. The wave function collapsed.
**The Eraser:**
If you record the data (Which slit) but *destroy the hard drive before looking at it*... the interference pattern COMES BACK.
It is as if the electron knows whether you *will* know.

## 3. Pilot Wave Theory (Bohm)
Is there a way out?
David Bohm suggested the **Pilot Wave**.
The Particle is real. It surfs on a Wave.
The Wave goes through both slits. The Particle goes through one.
The Wave guides the Particle.
It explains the pattern without "Collapse".
But it requires the universe to be Non-Local (Superluminal connections).
Most physicists prefer Cophenhagen or Many Worlds.

### Fact Box
*   **Buckyballs:** We have done the double-slit experiment with Carbon-60 molecules (Soccer balls). Huge objects. They still wave. There is a proposal to do it with a Virus. Imagine a Virus in superposition of being in two places at once.
