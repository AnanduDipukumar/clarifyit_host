## Introduction: The Horror movie
If this was a movie, nobody would believe it.
A fish opens its mouth.
Inside, looking back at you, is a pair of eyes.
It's not the fish's tongue. It's a crustacean.

## 1. The Heist
*Cymothoa exigua* swims into the fish's gills.
It clamps onto the base of the tongue.
It drinks the blood until the tongue withers away and falls off.
Does the fish die? No.
The parasite attaches itself to the remaining muscle stub.
It literally acts as a prosthetic tongue.
The fish can use it to grip food. The parasite shares the meal.

## 2. Gender Swap
They are all born male.
When they enter a fish, the first one turns female and grows huge (to become the tongue).
If a male enters later, he hangs out in the gills to mate with the tongue.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Cymothoa exigua** is a parasitic isopod that severs the blood vessels in a fish's tongue, causing it to atrophy. The parasite then attaches to the remaining stub and functions as a replacement tongue for the host. It is the only known instance in the animal kingdom of a parasite functionally replacing an entire organ of its host.

## Introduction: The Mango Fly
In the rainforests of West Africa, Deer Flies (Mango Flies) bite.
They inject larvae into your blood.
The larvae grow into worms (up to 7cm long).
They migrate through your subcutaneous tissue (under the skin).

## 1. Calabar Swellings
Usually, you don't feel them moving.
Sometimes they stop, causing itchy swellings (Calabar Swellings).
But sometimes, they cross across the bridge of the nose and enter the conjunctiva of the eye.
You can see it. You can feel it.
It doesn't cause blindness, but the psychological terror is real.
Doctors often have to surgically extract it while it is visible.

## 2. The Trap
You can't just take a pill to kill them all at once.
If you kill too many Loa Loa worms instantly (using Ivermectin), the dead bodies clog your brain capillaries, causing a fatal coma.
Treatment has to be slow and careful.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Loa loa** (the African eye worm) is a nematode worm transmitted by the bite of deer flies. The adult worms live in the subcutaneous tissue of humans and occasionally migrate across the **Conjunctiva** of the eye, where they are visibly moving. While generally not blinding, the infection causes localized angioedema and significant psychological distress.

## Introduction: The Stereotype
In the early 1900s, Northern Americans stereotyped Southerners (poor whites and blacks alike) as lethargic, slow, and dim-witted.
"They sit on the porch all day."
It turns out, 40% of the South was infected with **Hookworm**.

## 1. The Vampire
Hookworm larvae live in warm, moist soil (outhouses).
If you walk barefoot, they burrow into your feet.
They ride your blood to your lungs, you cough them up, swallow them, and they latch onto your intestines.
They drink blood.
A massive infection causes severe **Anemia**.
Your brain doesn't get enough oxygen. You feel exhausted. You can't think. You stunt growth in children.

## 2. Rockefeller
John D. Rockefeller (the richest man in history) funded the **Sanitary Commission**.
They built millions of outhouses. They gave away shoes.
They eradicated the disease.
Within a generation, the "laziness" disappeared. Economic productivity skyrocketed.
It was one of the greatest public health victories in history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hookworm** (*Necator americanus*) is a parasitic intestinal worm that feeds on host blood, causing iron-deficiency anemia and protein loss. In the early 20th-century American South, widespread infection caused chronic lethargy and cognitive impairment, fueling the stereotype of the "Lazy Southerner." The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission's eradication campaign revolutionized the region's health and economy.

## Introduction: The Pain
You drink dirty water containing water fleas (Copepods).
A year later, a blister forms on your leg.
It feels like fire.
To stop the pain, you put your leg in water.
The blister bursts, and a 3-foot white worm comes out to release its eggs into the water.
If you pull it, it breaks (and you get sepsis).
You have to wind it out on a stick, centimeter by centimeter, for weeks.
This is likely the "Fiery Serpent" of the Bible.

## 1. The Carter Center
In 1986, there were 3.5 Million cases a year.
President Jimmy Carter made it his mission to kill the worm.
Not with drugs (there is no cure). But with **Filter Straws**.
If you filter the water, you don't eat the flea.

## 2. Extinction
Today, there are fewer than 15 cases a year worldwide.
It is set to be the second human disease (after Smallpox) to be eradicated from the face of the Earth.
And the first to be done without a vaccine.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dracunculiasis** (Guinea Worm Disease) is caused by the nematode *Dracunculus medinensis*. Infection occurs by drinking water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas. The worm migrates to the skin, causing a painful blister that forces the host to seek water, completing the life cycle. Global eradication efforts led by the **Carter Center** have reduced cases by 99.99% using simple water filtration.

## Introduction: Ophiocordyceps unilateralis
The video game *The Last of Us* is based on a real fungus.
In the Amazon, you find "Graveyards" of ants clamped onto leaves.
They are the victims of **Cordyceps**.

## 1. The Takeover
Spores land on the ant. They drill inside.
The fungus grows through the body, digesting non-essential organs.
It grows *around* the muscles, controlling them like a puppeteer. Interestingly, it leaves the brain intact until the end.
The ant is a prisoner in its own body.

## 2. The Summit
The fungus forces the ant to climb exactly 25cm up a plant (perfect humidity).
It forces the jaws to clamp shut (The Death Grip).
Then, it kills the ant.
A fungal stalk bursts out of the ant's head and rains spores down on the colony below.
Ants are so terrified of this that they will carry infected members far away and dump them.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ophiocordyceps unilateralis** is an entomopathogenic fungus that infects ants. It modifies the host's behavior via chemical manipulation, forcing the ant to climb to a location with optimal microclimate for fungal growth. After killing the host, the fungus sprouts a fruiting body from the ant's head to disperse spores. It represents one of nature's most complex examples of **Extended Phenotype**.
