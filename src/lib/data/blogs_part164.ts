## Introduction: The Tower of London
In 1215, King John was a tyrant. If he didn't like you, you disappeared.
The Barons forced him to sign the **Magna Carta**.
One clause changed history:
**"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."**
This evolved into **Habeas Corpus** (Latin for "You shall have the body").
It demands that a Jailer must bring the Prisoner to Court and prove *why* he is detained.

## 1. The Power of the Writ
It is called "The Great Writ".
If the police arrest you and hold you without charge...
Your lawyer files a Writ of Habeas Corpus.
A Judge orders the police: **"Bring him here. Now."**
If the police cannot show a valid legal reason for the arrest... the Judge orders your release immediately.
It prevents "Disappearing".
It is the difference between a Democracy and a Police State.

## 2. Suspension (Lincoln and The Civil War)
The Constitution says Habeas Corpus cannot be suspended...
**"Unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."**
Abraham Lincoln suspended it in 1861.
He arrested Confederate sympathizers in Maryland (a border state) to stop them from sabotaging trains.
He held them without trial.
Chief Justice Taney said it was illegal. Lincoln ignored him.
"Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself to go to pieces, lest that one be violated?"

## 3. Modern Challenges (Guantanamo)
After 9/11, the US held "Enemy Combatants" at Guantanamo Bay.
The government argued: "They are not citizens. They are not on US soil. The Writ does not apply."
The Supreme Court (Boumediene v. Bush, 2008) disagreed.
They ruled that Habeas Corpus is a fundamental human right that checks the Executive branch, even in war.
The King is never above the Law.

> It was built by... **The American Bar Association**.
> Americans care more about the Magna Carta than the British do, because our entire Constitution is based on it.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Habeas Corpus** ("Show me the body") is the legal procedure that protects against unlawful imprisonment. Originating from the **Magna Carta** (1215), it allows any prisoner to demand a review of their detention by a neutral judge. While leaders like **Lincoln** have suspended it during crises to protect the state, the Courts generally uphold it as the primary safeguard of personal liberty against executive tyranny.

## Introduction: The Infinite Trial
Imagine a world without Double Jeopardy.
The Prosecutor charges you with robbery. You win.
He charges you again next week. You win.
He charges you again.
Eventually, you run out of money. Or a jury gets tired. Or you die.
The State has infinite resources. You do not.
The **5th Amendment** prevents the State from using its power to harass a citizen into a conviction.

## 1. "Acquitted" Means Forever
Once a verdict of "Not Guilty" is read... it is over.
Even if you walk out of court and confess on TV.
Even if they find the murder weapon in your house the next day.
They cannot try you again.
This protects the finality of judgments.
Society needs to move on.

## 2. The Exceptions (Dual Sovereignty)
There are loopholes.
*   **Civil Court:** OJ Simpson was acquitted of murder (Prison), but found liable for "Wrongful Death" in civil court (Money). The burden of proof is lower ("Preponderance of evidence" vs "Beyond reasonable doubt").
*   **Federal vs State:** If you rob a bank, you break State Law *and* Federal Law.
If the State acquits you... the Feds can try you.
This is the **Dual Sovereignty Doctrine**.

## 3. The Movie "Double Jeopardy" is Wrong
In the movie, Ashley Judd is convicted of killing her husband (who framed her).
She finds out he is alive.
She thinks: "I've already been convicted for killing him. I can shoot him now and it's free."
**False.**
The first conviction was a factual error.
Shooting him now is a **New Crime** (different date, different location).
You would go to jail. Law is not a coupon.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The UK Change:** In 2005, England **repealed** strict Double Jeopardy.
> For serious crimes (Murder/Rape), if "New and Compelling Evidence" (like DNA) is found, you *can* be retried.
> The US has not done this. We believe it is better to let a guilty man go free than to live in a system where the government can keep retrying you until they win.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Double Jeopardy** (5th Amendment) prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime after an acquittal. It exists to correct the power imbalance between the State (infinite resources) and the Citizen. While it grants immunity even if new evidence arises, exceptions like **Dual Sovereignty** (Federal vs State) and **Civil Suits** still allow for multiple forms of liability for the same act.

## Introduction: Rivalrous vs Non-Rivalrous
If I steal your apple, you have no apple. This is **Rivalrous**.
If I copy your song... we both have the song. This is **Non-Rivalrous**.
So why is copying illegal?
Because if you can't make money from the song... you won't write it.
IP Law is a trade-off: We give you a temporary **Monopoly** to encourage you to invent.

## 1. The Threebuckets
1.  **Copyright:** Art (Books, Music, Code). Lasts **Life of Author + 70 Years**.
2.  **Patent:** Inventions (Drug, Engine). Lasts **20 Years**. Then it becomes Generic.
3.  **Trademark:** Brand Identity (Nike Swoosh). Lasts **Forever** (as long as you use it). Stops customer confusion.

## 2. The Mickey Mouse Protection Act
Copyright was originally 14 years.
But every time Mickey Mouse (1928) was about to enter the Public Domain, Disney lobbied Congress to extend the term.
They did this for decades.
Finally, in **2024**, they lost.
"Steamboat Willie" (the original Mickey) entered the Public Domain.
You can now legally make a Mickey Mouse horror movie (and people did).
Cultural icons belong to the public... eventually.

## 3. The Tragedy of the Anticommons
If you own *too much* IP, you stifle innovation.
In the Smartphone Wars (Apple vs Samsung), they spent more money on Lawyers than R&D.
Patenting "Rounded Corners" or "Slide to Unlock".
This is a **Patent Thicket**.
It forces competitors to pay rent instead of innovating.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Happy Birthday:** For years, Warner Chappell Music claimed they owned the copyright to "Happy Birthday to You".
> Movies had to pay $10,000 to sing it. (That's why characters in movies always sing "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow").
> In 2016, a judge found the copyright was invalid. It was actually Public Domain all along.
> Warner had to pay back **$14 Million**.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Intellectual Property (IP)** creates a legal monopoly on ideas to incentivize creation. It comes in three forms: **Copyright** (Art), **Patent** (Function), and **Trademark** (Brand). While necessary for innovation, excessive IP protection (like the **Mickey Mouse Protection Act**) can lead to a **Tragedy of the Anticommons**, where ownership gridlock prevents new creators from building on the past ("Standing on the shoulders of giants").

        description: "Everyone knows the lady who sued McDonald's because her coffee was hot. 'Frivolous lawsuit!' actually... she had 3rd degree burns. How PR spun the truth.",

## Introduction: The Joke
In 1994, Stella Liebeck (79) sued McDonald's for coffee burns.
Every comedian (Leno, Letterman) made the joke:
"Lady is surprised coffee is hot! America is litigious!"
It became the poster child for **Tort Reform** (Laws to limit lawsuits).
But the media lied to you.

## 1. The Injury (Warning: Graphic)
Stella was not driving. She was parked.
The coffee spill caused **Third-Degree Burns** on her pelvic region.
Her skin was burned off.
She required **Skin Grafts**.
She spent 8 days in the hospital and 2 years recovering.
She nearly died.

## 2. Gross Negligence
Why was the coffee so hot?
McDonald's corporate policy required coffee to be held at **180-190°F (88°C)**.
At that temp, liquid destroys skin in **3 seconds**.
Home coffee is usually 135-140°F.
McDonald's had received **700 reports** of burns before Stella.
They knew the risk. They decided it was cheaper to pay settlements than lower the temperature (which impacted taste/sales).
That is **Calculated Negligence**.

## 3. Punitive Damages
Stella asked for $20,000 to cover medical bills.
McDonald's offered $800.
The Jury was furious.
They awarded her the medical costs... PLUS **$2.7 Million** in Punitive Damages.
Why $2.7M?
It was exactly **Two Days** of McDonald's coffee sales.
The point of Torts is not just compensation. It is **Deterrence**.
You have to hit the company where it hurts to make them change.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Outcome:** The Judge reduced the award (to about $600k), and they settled privately.
> But McDonald's lowered the temperature of their coffee.
> And they put the **"CAUTION: HOT"** warning on the cup.
> The lawsuit made the world safer. The "Frivolous" narrative was a PR campaign by corporate lobbyists.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Tort Law** allows citizens to sue for damages caused by negligence. The **McDonald's Coffee Case** is famous for being cited as "frivolous," but the facts reveal **Gross Negligence** (coffee served at skin-melting 190°F despite 700 prior burn reports). The massive jury award (Punitive Damages) was intended to punish the corporation for prioritizing profit over safety, demonstrating that Torts serve a crucial regulatory function in society.

## Introduction: The Legal Void
1945. The Nazis are defeated.
The Allies captured the leaders (Goering, Hess, Speer).
What do you do with them?
Shoot them? (Churchill wanted to).
Let them go?
They argue: "We didn't break any laws. The Holocaust was **Legal** under German Law."
This forced the Allies to invent a new concept: **Crimes Against Humanity**.

## 1. The Superior Orders Defense
The Nazis' main defense: **"Befehl ist Befehl"** (Orders are Orders).
"I was a soldier. I swore an oath. If I disobeyed, I would be shot."
It is a strong legal argument. Every army relies on obedience.
The Tribunal rejected it.
**"The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government... does not relieve him from responsibility."**
At a certain point (Genocide), **Moral Choice** overrides **Legal Duty**.

## 2. Albert Speer (The Good Nazi?)
Speer was Hitler's architect and Minister of Armaments.
He used slave labor.
But at the trial, he was the only one who said: "I am sorry. I bear responsibility."
He charmed the judges.
He got 20 years in prison. The others were hanged.
Did he survive because he was less guilty? Or because he was more polite?

## 3. The Legacy (The ICC)
Nuremberg created the **International Criminal Court (ICC)**.
Today, we prosecute warlords from Rwanda and Yugoslavia.
But it has a weakness: **Enforcement**.
The ICC has no police.
Vladimir Putin has an ICC arrest warrant. But unless he travels to a member country... nothing happens.
International Justice is only as strong as the countries willing to enforce it.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Interpreters:** Nuremberg was the first time **Simultaneous Translation** was used (IBM technology).
> Judges spoke English, French, Russian, and German.
> Without the headsets and the team of translators, the trial would have taken 10 years.
> It was a triumph of logistics as much as law.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Nuremberg Trials** (1945) established the principle that individuals are responsible for their actions even during war. It rejected the **"Superior Orders"** defense ("I was just following orders"), ruling that fundamental human rights transcend national laws. This established the category of **Crimes Against Humanity** and laid the foundation for modern International Law and the **ICC**, asserting that no state or soldier is above absolute morality.
