## Introduction: Glitch in the Matrix
It feels real.
The coffee is hot. The table is hard.
But in VR, the table looks hard. With haptic suits, it feels hard.
In 50 years, games went from *Pong* to *Unreal Engine 5*.
In 10,000 years, simulations will be indistinguishable from reality.
If it is *possible* to simulate a universe... then someone probably has.
And if they run millions of simulations, and there is only 1 "Real" universe...
Statistically, you are likely in a Sim.

## 1. The Trilemma (Bostrom)
One of these must be true:
1.  **Extinction:** Civilizations go extinct before they reach "Post-Human" simulation tech. (Nuclear war/ASI).
2.  **Apathy:** Post-Humans *can* run sims, but choose not to (Ethics? Boring?).
3.  **Simulation:** We are in a sim.
If 1 and 2 are false, then 3 is statistically certain.
Since we are trying to build sims right now (Metaverse), #2 seems unlikely.
So it's either Extinction or Simulation.

## 2. Rendering Tricks (Observer Effect)
Video games only render what you look at (Frustum Culling).
Quantum Mechanics says: Particles don't have a defined position until you measure them.
Is this **Computational Optimization**?
Why calculate the position of every electron in Andromeda if nobody is looking?
Just render a fuzzy blur (Probability Wave) until a telescope points at it.
It saves RAM.
Max Tegmark (MIT) argues that the universe is purely mathematical. Physics is just code.

## 3. The Ethical Problem (Sims with Feelings)
If we are sims, do we have rights?
If you unplug the computer, is it genocide?
If we are "Ancestry Simulations" (running history to see what happened), does the Simulator enjoy watching our suffering (Wars/Plagues)?
Is God just a teenage gamer playing *The Sims*?
"The Problem of Evil" becomes "The Problem of Boredom". A perfect universe is boring gameplay. Disasters make it interesting.

### Fact Box
*   **Base Reality:** If we are in a sim, our creators might be in a sim too. It could be "Turtles all the way down." A nested stack of universes. We can never know if we are at the top.

## Introduction: Laplace's Demon
Pierre-Simon Laplace (1814) said:
If a Demon knew the position and velocity of every atom in the universe, it could calculate the Future perfectly.
The Big Bang set the bowling ball rolling.
Everything that happens (including you reading this sentence) was determined 13.8 billion years ago.
**Hard Determinism.**
You have no choice. You are a biological robot following code written by physics.

## 1. The Libet Experiment (1983)
Benjamin Libet hooked people to EEG.
"Move your wrist whenever you want."
He watched the brain.
**Result:**
The brain fired the "Readiness Potential" (Prepare to move) **300 milliseconds BEFORE** the person felt the conscious urge to move.
Your brain decided to move. Then, 0.3 seconds later, it told your Consciousness: "Hey, I decided to move. Act like it was your idea."
Consciousness is a spectator. A press secretary justifying decisions made by the unconscious machinery.

## 2. Compatibilism (The Compromise)
Philosophers (Daniel Dennett) hate this.
If no Free Will -> No Responsibility.
Why punish a murderer if he "couldn't have done otherwise"?
**Compatibilism:**
You are free as long as you are acting according to your desires.
Even if your desires are determined by biology/environment.
"I can do what I start, but I cannot start what I start." (Schopenhauer).
You are free to drink coffee if you want coffee. But you are not free to *not want* coffee.

## 3. Quantum Indeterminacy
Does Quantum Randomness save us?
Atoms are random.
So the future isn't fixed!
**The Problem:**
Randomness is not Freedom.
If a geiger counter click determines my action, I am not "Free". I am just "Random".
Free Will requires **Agency**, not just unpredictability.
We haven't found a place for Agency in the laws of physics yet.

### Fact Box
*   **Hungry Judges:** A study showed judges grant parole 65% of the time after breakfast, and near 0% of the time before lunch. Is "Justice" blind, or is it just blood sugar levels? (Biological Determinism).

## Introduction: The Emperor
Marcus Aurelius was the most powerful man on Earth (Roman Emperor).
He was also miserable.
Plagues. Wars. Betrayals. A terrible son.
He wrote a diary to himself (**Meditations**).
"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

## 1. Dichotomy of Control (Epictetus)
There are two buckets.
**Bucket A (Control):** Your thoughts, your actions, your character.
**Bucket B (No Control):** The weather, the economy, other people's opinions, death.
Stoicism is simple: Pour 100% of your energy into Bucket A.
Ignore Bucket B.
If you worry about Bucket B (e.g., "I hope he likes me"), you are insane. You are trying to control the uncontrollable. You will suffer.

## 2. Memento Mori (Remember Death)
"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."
Death is not a tragedy. It is natural.
Fearing death is like fearing the sun setting.
Thinking about death clarifies life.
It strips away the bullshit.
"Will I care about this traffic jam on my deathbed? No." -> Then don't care about it now.

## 3. Amor Fati (Love Fate)
Nietzsche (not a Stoic, but adopted this):
Don't just *bear* what happens to you. **Love it.**
Your house burned down? Good. It's a chance to practice non-attachment.
You got fired? Good. It's a chance to reinvent yourself.
The obstacle is the way.
It is the ultimate resilience software. You cannot hurt a Stoic because he decides that getting hurt is part of the plan.

### Fact Box
*   **Stockdale Paradox:** Admiral James Stockdale (Vietnam POW) survived 7 years of torture. He said the "Optimists" died first (because they hoped to be out by Christmas, and died of broken hearts). The Realists (Stoics) survived. They accepted the brutal reality but kept the faith they would prevail in the end.
