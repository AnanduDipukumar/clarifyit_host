## Introduction: The Drop
Imagine if the stock market lost 1/4 of its value before lunch.
Traders ran onto the floor screaming.
They couldn't sell fast enough.
The printers jammed.

## 1. Portfolio Insurance
The culprit was a new algorithm called **Portfolio Insurance**.
It was designed to limit losses.
"If the market drops 3%, sell futures to hedge."
Every bank used the same formula.
So when the market dropped 3%, everyone sold at once.
This pushed the market down 5%.
Which triggered more selling.
It was the first **Feedback Loop** caused by machines.

## 2. Circuit Breakers
To stop this from happening again, they invented **Circuit Breakers**.
If the S&P 500 drops 7%, the market shuts down for 15 minutes.
"Everyone take a breath."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Black Monday** (October 19, 1987) was the largest single-day percentage drop in US stock market history (-22.6%). It was largely driven by **Program Trading**, where automated algorithms (Portfolio Insurance) created a selling cascade. It led to the implementation of market-wide Circuit Breakers to pause trading during panic.

## Introduction: Electronic Panic
May 6, 2010. 2:45 PM.
The Dow Jones plunged 1,000 points.
Stocks like Accenture traded for $0.01.
Then, just as fast, it recovered.
Nobody knew why.

## 1. The Hound of Hounslow
Navinder Sarao was a day trader working from his parents' house.
He hated High Frequency Traders (HFT).
He wrote a bot to **Spoof** them.
He placed massive sell orders to scare the bots, then canceled them before they executed.
On that day, his spoofing tricked the algorithms into a death spiral.

## 2. The Arrest
He made $40 million.
He didn't live like a king. He didn't even buy a car.
The FBI extradited him 5 years later.
It showed how fragile our algorithmic economy really is.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **2010 Flash Crash** was a rapid, deep, and volatile stock market crash that lasted 36 minutes. It was triggered by **Spoofing** (illegal manipulative trading) by a lone trader, Navinder Sarao, which caused High Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms to aggressively sell off, temporarily wiping out $1 Trillion in market value.

## Introduction: The Baht
In the 90s, Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia were economic miracles.
They borrowed huge amounts of US Dollars to build skyscrapers.
But their currencies were pegged (fixed) to the Dollar.
When speculators (like George Soros) attacked the Thai Baht, the government ran out of dollars to defend it.
They had to let it float. It crashed.

## 1. The Domino Effect
If your income is in Baht but your debt is in Dollars, and the Baht crashes... you are bankrupt.
The crisis spread to Korea (the IMF had to bail them out).
Sentiments turned against the West.
South Koreans stood in line to donate their gold wedding rings to save the country.

## 2. Lessons Learned
Asian countries learned: "Never trust the IMF. Hoard Dollar Reserves."
This is why China sits on $3 Trillion today.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Asian Financial Crisis** began in Thailand in 1997 when the government was forced to float the Baht due to lack of foreign currency to support its fixed exchange rate. The resulting currency collapse spread to South Korea and Indonesia, causing massive debt defaults and leading to controversial IMF bailouts that imposed strict austerity measures.

## Introduction: Irrational Exuberance
The Internet was new. Everyone knew it was the future.
Investors threw money at anything.
**Pets.com** raised $82 million. They spent millions on a Super Bowl ad with a sock puppet.
They bought dog food for $10 and sold it for $5 (to get market share).
They hoped to make it up in volume. (Math doesn't work that way).

## 1. The Pop
In 2000, interest rates rose. Free money dried up.
Nasdaq fell 78%.
Companies with no revenue (Webvan, eToys) vanished overnight.
Amazon lost 90% of its value (but survived).

## 2. The Infrastructure
The Bubble wasn't useless.
Investors paid to lay fiber optic cables across the ocean.
When they went bankrupt, the cables stayed.
We built the modern internet on the cheap ruins of the Dot Com boom.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Dot Com Bubble** (late 1990s) was a speculative mania where investors poured capital into internet-based startups regardless of profitability. Valuations disconnected from reality (high P/E ratios). When capital dried up in 2000, the bubble burst, wiping out trillions in wealth, though it funded the essential telecommunications infrastructure we use today.

## Introduction: Printing
President Mugabe needed money to pay the army and government workers.
The economy was shrinking (due to farm seizures). Tax revenue was zero.
So he ordered the central bank to print money.
Not just a little. A lot.

## 1. The Spiral
Prices rose. So they printed higher denomination bills.
$100. $1 Million. $1 Billion.
Finally, the **One Hundred Trillion Dollar Note**.
It wasn't enough to buy a bus ticket.
People had to carry cash in wheelbarrows.
Prices doubled every 24 hours. If you got paid, you ran to the market immediately.

## 2. The End
In 2009, they gave up.
They abandoned the Zimbabwe Dollar and just used US Dollars.
Inflation stopped instantly.
Money is only worth what people believe it is worth.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hyperinflation** in Zimbabwe (peaking in 2008) reached an estimated 79.6 billion percent month-on-month. It was caused by the government printing money to pay debts amid an economic collapse. It resulted in the abandonment of the national currency and serves as a modern warning against unconstrained monetary expansion.
