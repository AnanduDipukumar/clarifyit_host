## Introduction: The Universal Burger
How do you know if the Yen is undervalued?
It's complicated. You typically need a basket of goods (Bread, Rent, Gas).
But quality varies. Bread in France is different from Bread in Japan.
But a **Big Mac**... is a Big Mac.
It is identical in 120 countries.
It requires local labor, rent, electricity, cheese, beef, and lettuce.
It is the perfect benchmark.

## 1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
In 2023:
*   US Big Mac: $5.58.
*   India Big Mac (Maharaja Mac): $2.50.
*   Swiss Big Mac: $7.26.
This implies the Indian Rupee is **Undervalued** (Things are cheap).
This implies the Swiss Franc is **Overvalued** (Things are expensive).
If exchange rates were "Fair" (PPP), a Big Mac would cost the same everywhere.

## 2. Why it matters
It exposes lying governments.
Argentina famously faked their inflation data.
But they couldn't fake the price of McDonald's.
The Big Mac Index showed inflation was 20% higher than the government claimed.
So the government tried to force McDonald's to freeze the price of the Big Mac.
McDonald's just started advertising the Quarter Pounder instead.
The Market always wins.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> **The Big Mac Index** is an informal way of measuring **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** between two currencies. By comparing the price of a standard good (The Big Mac) across countries, it provides a "lighthearted" but surprisingly accurate guide to whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued against the US Dollar.

## Introduction: The Lever
A.W. Phillips noticed a pattern in the UK (1958).
When Unemployment goes **Down** (Lots of jobs)... Inflation goes **Up** (Prices rise).
Why?
If everyone has a job, bosses have to pay higher wages to attract talent.
Higher wages = People buy more stuff = Prices go up.
Governments thought they had a "Lever."
"Let's accept 4% inflation to get unemployment to 2%!"

## 1. Stagflation (The Curve Breaks)
In the 1970s, the lever broke.
We had High Inflation (10%) AND High Unemployment (8%).
This was **Stagflation**.
It shouldn't be possible.
Milton Friedman explained it: The Phillips Curve only works in the **Short Run**.
In the Long Run, printing money doesn't create jobs; it just creates expensive bread.

## 2. The NAIRU
Central Bankers now target the **NAIRU** (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment).
This is the "Natural" rate of unemployment (maybe 4%).
If you try to push unemployment below this natural limit, you explode the economy.
It is a cruel accepted fact: A healthy economy *needs* some people to be unemployed.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Phillips Curve** depicts an inverse relationship between **unemployment** and **inflation**. Historically, lower unemployment correlated with higher inflation. However, the Stagflation of the 1970s proved this relationship is not stable in the long run. Expectations of inflation eventually adapt, leading to the conclusion that monetary policy cannot permanently lower unemployment.

        description: "The theory: If we cut taxes for the rich, they will invest, create jobs, and the wealth will 'trickle down' to the poor. Does it work?",

## Introduction: Supply Side
"Trickle-Down" is an insult. The real name is **Supply-Side Economics**.
The logic:
You don't help the economy by giving money to consumers (Demand).
You help it by making it easier to *produce* (Supply).
Cut Corporate Tax -> Companies build factories -> Hiring boom -> Wages rise.
"A rising tide lifts all boats."

## 1. The Reality
Reagan tried it (1980s). Bush tried it (2000s). Trump tried it (2017).
Did it work?
GDP went up. The Stock Market went up.
But wages for the bottom 50% stayed flat.
The rich didn't "Invest in factories". They did **Stock Buybacks** and saved the money.
The wealth trickled *up*, or stayed in the reservoir.

## 2. The Usefulness
It *does* work if taxes are insanely high.
If taxes are 90% (like in the 1950s), nobody works. Cutting to 50% helps.
But if taxes are already 20%... cutting to 15% doesn't create magic.
It just creates a deficit.

> **Fact Box**

> **The Horse and Sparrow:**
> The term "Trickle Down" comes from the humorist Will Rogers, mocking the theory in the 1930s:
> "If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows."
> The poor are the sparrows eating manure.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Trickle-Down Economics** (Supply-Side) argues that reducing taxes on businesses and the wealthy stimulates business investment in the short term and benefits society at large in the long term. Critics argue that despite increasing overall GDP, it exacerbates **Wealth Inequality** because the benefits rarely reach the working class in the form of higher wages.

## Introduction: The Pain of Progress
The Candle Maker hates the Lightbulb.
The Horse Breeder hates the Car.
The Taxi Driver hates Uber.
New technology destroys old jobs.
Should we stop it?
Joseph Schumpeter (1942) said: **No.**
This storm of **Creative Destruction** is the engine of wealth.

## 1. Zombie Companies
If you protect the old industries (Bailouts), you get **Zombie Companies**.
They suck up capital and labor but produce nothing of value.
For the forest to grow, the dead wood must burn.
It is painful for the people in the fire.
But the ash fertilizes the next generation of giants.

## 2. Innovation
Schumpeter argued that **Monopolies** are actually good (temporarily).
The hope of a monopoly profit (becoming Google) drives people to innovate.
Then, eventually, a new kid destroys that monopoly.
It is a cycle of mutation.
A static economy is a dying economy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Creative Destruction** is the concept that the dismantling of long-standing practices and industries is necessary for innovation. Coined by **Joseph Schumpeter**, it describes the "process of industrial mutation" that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. It frames economic loss (bankruptcy) as a sign of progress.

## Introduction: 0% and 100%
The Laffer Curve is simple logic.
*   If the Tax Rate is **0%**, the Government collects **$0**.
*   If the Tax Rate is **100%**, the Government collects **$0** (Because nobody will work if the government takes it all).
Therefore, the optimal tax rate must be somewhere in the middle.
It is a bell curve.

## 1. The Forbidden Zone
Laffer argued that the US in the 1970s (70% tax rate) was on the *wrong side* of the curve.
We were taxing so much that we discouraged work.
If we cut taxes, people would work harder, and the government would actually get *more* money.
This was the intellectual basis for **Reaganomics**.

## 2. Where is the peak?
The debate is: Where is the peak?
Laffer thought the peak was around 20%.
Most economists think the peak is around **70%**.
(Meaning you can tax up to 70% before revenue starts dropping).
The Laffer Curve is true in theory, but often used as a lie to justify tax cuts for donors.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Laffer Curve** illustrates the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. It posits that there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. If taxes are too high (above the optimum), cutting them will incentivize economic activity so much that total tax collection actually increases. It is a cornerstone of **Supply-Side Economics**.
