## Introduction: The Incident
1959. Soviet Union.
Experienced hikers camped on Kholat Syakhl ("Dead Mountain").
They never returned.
Rescuers found the tent slashed open... from the inside.
The hikers had run into the snow in socks or barefoot.

## 1. The Horror
The bodies were scattered.
Some died of hypothermia.
Others had crushed skulls and ribs (like a car crash) but no external bruises.
One woman was missing her tongue and eyes.
Their clothes were radioactive.
Yeti? Aliens? KGB testing?

## 2. The Solution (Maybe)
In 2021, Swiss scientists used Disney's *Frozen* snow animation code to simulate the slope.
**The Theory:** A small, delayed slab avalanche.
It buried the tent. They cut their way out.
They ran to the woods for shelter.
Paradoxical Undressing (Hypothermia makes you feel hot) explains the nakedness.
Scavengers (animals) ate the tongue/eyes.
The radioactivity was from camping lanterns (Thorium mantles).
Is it solved? 90% yes.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Dyatlov Pass incident** (1959) involved the mysterious deaths of nine hikers in the Ural Mountains. The bizarre evidence (internal injuries, missing clothes, slashed tent) fueled decades of conspiracy theories. Recent computer models suggest a **Slab Avalanche** crushed the tent, forcing an escape into the freezing night.

## Introduction: 1872
The *Mary Celeste* was found drifting near Portugal.
Sails set. Cargo intact.
The Captain's log book was there (last entry 10 days ago).
But no people. No lifeboat.
No sign of struggle/pirates.

## 1. Theories
**Mutiny?** No blood.
**Sea Monster?** Unlikely.
**Alcohol Fumes?** The ship was carrying 1,700 barrels of industrial alcohol.
Maybe a barrel leaked.
The fumes built up in the hold.
The Captain feared an explosion.
He ordered everyone into the lifeboat to tow behind the ship until it aired out.
The tow rope snapped.
The ship sailed away. The lifeboat sank.

## 2. The Verdict
It fits the facts.
The crew didn't "disappear". They abandoned ship and drowned.
The mystery is just a tragedy.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Mary Celeste** was an American merchant brigantine discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean in 1872. The crew had vanished, but the ship was seaworthy and fully provisioned. The most plausible theory is that the crew abandoned ship temporarily due to fear of an explosion from leaking alcohol fumes, and were lost at sea when their lifeboat became separated.

## Introduction: 1587
Before Jamestown or Plymouth, there was Roanoke (North Carolina).
John White (Governor) left to get supplies from England.
He got stuck (War with Spain).
He returned 3 years later.

## 1. Gone
The fort was dismantled (not burned).
No bodies. No crosses (the signal for distress).
Just "CROATOAN" carved on a post.
Croatoan was a nearby island with friendly natives.

## 2. Integration
White tried to sail there, but a hurricane stopped him. He had to leave.
We now believe they didn't "vanish".
They were starving. They moved in with the Croatoan tribe.
They interlimbed.
Decades later, settlers reported seeing natives with grey eyes who spoke English.
They became us.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Roanoke Colony** was an early English settlement that disappeared between 1587 and 1590. Despite legends of supernatural disappearance, archaeological and genetic evidence suggests the settlers simply assimilated with local indigenous tribes (the Croatoan and others) to survive.

## Introduction: Impossible Tech
Gears were supposed to be invented in the Middle Ages (Clocks).
This device dated to 100 BC.
It was too advanced.
Some said aliens. Some said time travel.

## 1. The Function
It is an **Analog Computer**.
You turn a crank.
30 bronze gears spin.
Dials show the position of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.
It predicted Eclipses decades in advance.
It even tracked the dates of the Olympic Games.

## 2. Lost Knowledge
It proves the Greeks were far more advanced than we thought.
Archimedes probably designed the prototype.
When Rome fell, this technology was lost.
Humanity didn't build anything this complex again for 1,500 years.
Imagine where we would be if we hadn't forgotten.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Antikythera mechanism** is an ancient Greek hand-powered orrery, described as the oldest example of an **analogue computer**. Discovered in a shipwreck in 1901, it used a complex system of 30 bronze gears to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes.

## Introduction: Rapa Nui
Easter Island is the most isolated place on Earth.
The Moai statues stand on the coast, watching the land.
For years, we thought they rolled them on logs.
(The "Ecocide" theory says they cut down all the trees to move statues, then starved).

## 1. The Walk
New theory: They didn't roll them.
They walked them.
The statues have a low center of gravity (big bellies).
If you tie ropes to the head and rock it side-to-side (like moving a fridge), it "walks" forward.
Local legends always said: "The statues walked."
We just didn't listen.

## 2. Buried Bodies
Most photos show just heads.
But if you dig, they have full bodies buried underground.
Some even have \"Tattoos\" carved on their backs.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Moai** are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island between 1250 and 1500. Recent experiments proved that the massive statues could be moved upright by "walking" them with ropes, using a rocking motion, debunking the idea that their construction required the destruction of the island's forests for rollers.
