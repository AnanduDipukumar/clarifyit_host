## Introduction: The Raid
June 28, 1969. NYC.
The Stonewall Inn was a mafia-run bar (because legal bars couldn't serve gays).
Police raids were routine. You lined up, showed ID, and got arrested if you weren't wearing "gender appropriate" clothing.

## 1. The Riot
This night was different.
Instead of going into the paddy wagon, the crowd threw coins. Then bottles. Then bricks.
Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera are often credited with starting resistance.
The police barricaded *themselves* inside the bar for safety.
The riot lasted days.

## 2. Pride
One year later, the first "Christopher Street Liberation Day" march happen.
It was the first Gay Pride Parade.
It marked the shift from "Hiding in the closet" to "Out and Proud."

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Stonewall Riots** were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the gay community in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights.
