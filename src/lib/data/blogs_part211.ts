## Introduction: The Problem of Kindness
Darwin had a problem.
His theory said: "Survival of the Fittest."
So why does a worker bee sting an intruder and die to save the hive?
This is **Altruism**. It shouldn't exist. The "nice" genes should die out.
J.B.S. Haldane solved it.

## 1. The Math of Love
"I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins."
You share 50% of your DNA with a brother.
You share 12.5% with a cousin.
If you die to save 3 brothers, your genes actually make a profit (150% survival).
The Gene doesn't care if *you* survive. It cares if *copies of itself* survive.
**Kin Selection** explains why family bonds are biologically unbreakable.

## 2. Inclusive Fitness
It explains Eusociality (Ants/Bees).
Worker ants are sterile. They serve the Queen.
Why? Because they are sisters. Helping the Queen reproduce spreads their genes better than if they reproduced themselves.
Nature is not nice; Nature is just good at accounting.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> **Kin Selection** is an evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. This occurs because relatives share a high proportion of the same genes. It explains the existence of **Altruism** in nature.

## Introduction: Missing Links
Darwin predicted we would find a smooth gradient of fossils.
Fish -> Fish-Lizard -> Lizard.
Instead, we find layers of the same Fish for 10 million years... and then suddenly a Lizard.
Creationists use this to attack evolution.
Stephen Jay Gould explained it with **Punctuated Equilibrium**.

## 1. Stasis vs Change
Species don't change if they don't have to.
If the environment is stable, the shark stays a shark (Stasis).
Change only happens when disaster strikes (Asteroid, Volcano).
And when it happens, it happens *fast* (geologically speaking).
A new species might evolve in 50,000 years (an eyeblink in the fossil record).
That's why we don't see the "transition" steps; they happened too quickly to fossilize.

## 2. The Quantum Leap
Evolution is not a ramp; it is a staircase.
Long periods of boredom (Equilibrium) broken by sudden leaps (Punctuation).
We are the children of catastrophe.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Punctuated Equilibrium** is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record, the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history. This state of little change is called **Stasis**. When significant evolutionary change occurs, it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of speciation.

## Introduction: What is a Species?
Definition: "Two animals are the same species if they can breed and produce fertile offspring."
Horse + Donkey = Mule (Sterile). So Horse and Donkey are different species.
Simple.
Until you look at the **Ensatina Salamanders** in California.

## 1. The Ring
The salamanders migrated south around the Central Valley (which they can't cross).
One group went East (Mountains). One went West (Coast).
They evolved slightly differently as they moved south.
Salamander A can breed with B. B with C. C with D.
But at the bottom of the valley, where the East line meets the West line...
They look completely different. They cannot breed.
They are different species.
But they are connected by a unbroken chain of breeding.

## 2. Evolution in Space
This proves evolution happens gradually.
Usually, we see evolution over *Time* (Fossils).
Ring Species show us evolution over *Space*.
"Species" is just a label we put on a continuous spectrum.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Ring Species** is a connected series of neighboring populations where each can interbreed with closely related populations, but for which there exist at least two "end" populations in the series that are too distantly related to interbreed. It demonstrates that the concept of "Species" is fluid, not a fixed category.

## Introduction: Foster's Rule
On the mainland, you have to be average.
On an island, the rules break.
**Island Gigantism:** Small animals get huge (Komodo Dragons, Dodo Pigeons, Giant Tortoises) because there are no predators.
**Island Dwarfism:** Big animals get small (Pygmy Elephants, Homo Floresiensis "Hobbits") because there is limited food.

## 1. The Dodo
The Dodo was a pigeon that landed on Mauritius.
No predators. Lots of food.
So it got fat. It lost its wings (Why fly?). It lost its fear.
Then humans arrived.
We walked up to them and hit them with sticks.
They didn't run. They didn't know what a predator was.
Islands are evolutionary laboratories, but they are fragile.

## 2. The Hobbit
On the island of Flores, we found skeletons of tiny humans (3 feet tall).
They lived until 50,000 years ago.
They hunted tiny elephants.
They prove that humans are subject to the same evolutionary pressures as every other animal.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Island Gigantism** is a biological phenomenon in which the size of an animal species isolated on an island increases dramatically in comparison to its mainland relatives. This is usually due to a lack of predators and competition. Conversely, **Island Dwarfism** occurs when large animals shrink to adapt to limited resources.

## Introduction: The Ruler
Dinosaurs ruled for 160 million years.
Mammals were tiny rats hiding in holes.
We couldn't compete. They were too perfect.
And then... **Chicxulub**.

## 1. The Impact
The asteroid hit with the force of 10 billion atomic bombs.
The impact didn't kill most of them.
The **Dust** did.
Debris flew into space, surrounded the earth, and blocked the sun for 2 years.
Plants died -> Herbivores died -> Carnivores died.
75% of all species vanished.

## 2. The rise of the Rat
The big dinosaurs starved. They needed too much food.
But the tiny mammals (our ancestors) survived.
They ate insects and dead flesh. They had fur to stay warm.
When the sun came back, the monsters were gone.
The mammals inherited the Earth.
We are here because of a lucky rock.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **K-T Extinction** (Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event) occurred 66 million years ago. A massive asteroid impact (Chicxulub) caused a global winter that wiped out three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs. This event allowed mammals to diversify and eventually evolve into humans.
