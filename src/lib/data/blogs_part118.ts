## Introduction: Discovery
1920s. British engineers were building a railway in Pakistan.
They found burnt bricks. "Great bricks!" They used them for the track ballast.
They didn't unleash they were dismantling a 4000-year-old city (Harappa).
It turned out to be the largest civilization of the ancient world (bigger than Egypt and Mesopotamia combined).

## 1. The Technology
Mohenjo-Daro (Mound of the Dead).
Grid streets (North-South, East-West).
Every house had a bathroom.
Underground sewers (covered drains).
The "Great Bath" (Swimming pool).
Standardized weights and measures (cubits, bricks).
It was a utopia of municipal planning.

## 2. No Army?
We have found 0 weapons. 0 swords. 0 cracked skulls.
No palaces. No temples.
Were they a peaceful republic? A merchant state?
It breaks the rule that "Civilization needs Kings and War."
Or maybe we just haven't found the weapons yet.

## 3. The Collapse
1900 BC. The cities emptied.
People just left.
Why?
Climate Change. The Saraswati River dried up (Monsoon shift).
Without water, the cities died.
The survivors migrated East to the Ganges, becoming the Vedic culture.

### Fact Box
*   **The Script:** The Indus Script is still undeciphered. We have thousands of seals (Unicorn bull). 400 symbols. If we crack it, we unlock the words of a lost world. AI is currently trying.

## Introduction: The Moai
887 statues.
Average height: 13 feet. Weight: 14 tons.
Largest: 33 feet. 82 tons.
Quarried at Rano Raraku (volcano). Moved miles to the coast.
How?
Aliens? No. Leverage.

## 1. The Walking Theory
Terry Hunt (Archaeologist).
They attached ropes to the head.
Rocked it side to side. "Heave-Ho".
The statue "walked" upright.
The oral history explicitly says: "The statues walked."
We verified it with a team of 18 people.

## 2. Ecocide
Jared Diamond's theory: "They were stupid."
They cut down all palm trees to make rollers for the statues.
No trees -> No boats -> No fish.
Soil erosion -> No crops.
Starvation. Cannibalism. Collapse.
A warning for Earth.

## 3. The Rat Theory (Revisionist)
New evidence says rats (brought by Polynesians) ate the palm seeds. The rats killed the forest, not the humans.
The civilization didn't collapse until Europeans arrived (Smallpox, Slavery) in the 1700s.
The "Ecocide" story might be a myth to blame the victims.

### Fact Box
*   **The Eyes:** The statues originally had eyes made of white coral and red scoria pupils. They looked terrifyingly alive. The eyes were removed (or fell out) when the clans toppled them during the civil wars.

## Introduction: The Jungle
Tikal (Guatemala). Copan (Honduras). Chichen Itza (Mexico).
Massive stone pyramids.
Astronomy so precise they calculated the solar year to 365.242 days.
Zero (before Europe).
Then, in 900 AD, they abandoned the southern cities.
The jungle took them back.

## 1. Drought
Stalagmite data shows a mega-drought hit from 800-1000 AD.
The Maya relied on reservoirs (Cenotes/Chultuns).
The corn died.
The Kings claimed to talk to the Rain Gods.
When the rain didn't come... the people realized the Kings were liars.
They killed the Kings and left the cities.

## 2. Warfare
As resources shrank, wars exploded.
"Star Wars" (attacks timed to Venus).
It became a death spiral.
They didn't die out. They just moved North (Yucatan) or dispersed into villages.
Complexity has a cost. When the cost is too high, people choose simplicity.

## 3. The Calendar (2012)
The Long Count calendar ended on Dec 21, 2012.
People thought it meant Apocalypse.
To the Maya, it just meant "New Bak'tun" (New Cycle).
Like an odometer rolling over from 99999 to 00000.
We panicked for nothing.

### Fact Box
*   **Blue:** "Maya Blue" is a pivot pigment that never fades. It is made of Indigo and Palorskite clay. It is nanotechnology. We still can't synthesize it perfectly.

## Introduction: The Rivalry
Rome vs Carthage (Tunisia).
The Punic Wars.
Carthage was a naval power. Rome was a land power.
Rome copied a Carthaginian shipwreck to build their own navy.

## 1. The Crossing (218 BC)
Hannibal Barca hated Rome.
He took an army from Spain... over the Pyrenees... over the Rhone... over the Alps.
In Winter. With 37 War Elephants.
It was impossible. Thousands died.
But he arrived in Italy.
The Romans were terrified. "Unseen Monsters."

## 2. Cannae (The Perfect Battle)
Hannibal faced a massive Roman army (86,000 men).
He used a **Double Envelopment** (Pincer Movement).
He let his center retreat... then his wings swung around.
He surrounded a larger army.
He killed 50,000 Romans in one day.
It is still taught in military academies as the "Perfect Victory".

## 3. Delenda Est Carthago
Hannibal roamed Italy for 15 years but couldn't take Rome (no siege engines).
Rome eventually attacked Carthage (Scipio Africanus).
Hannibal had to go home to defend. He lost (Zama).
Rome was so angry they burned Carthage to the ground.
Looking for "Carthage" today? It's a suburb of Tunis.
Legend says they sowed the fields with salt so nothing would ever grow. (Probably a myth, salt was expensive).

### Fact Box
*   **Child Sacrifice:** Romans claimed Carthage sacrificed babies to Baal. We thought it was propaganda. Then we found the "Tophet" (Cemetery) with thousands of urns containing the charred bones of infants. It was real.

## Introduction: 1400 BC
Mexico Gulf Coast (Veracruz).
They built the first pyramids in America.
They invented the Ball Game (Ulama).
They invented the concept of "Zero".
They were the Greeks of the New World.

## 1. The Colossal Heads
Basalt boulders. 10 feet tall.
Helmets. Thick lips. Broad noses.
Some early theories (Ivan Van Sertima) said they looked African. Did Africans sail to America?
Most archaeologists say **No**.
The features match the local indigenous people of Tabasco today.
They were portraits of Kings.

## 2. Transportation
The stone came from Tuxtla Mountains (100km away).
They had no wheels. No beasts of burden (Horses/Oxen).
They dragged them through swamps. Or floated them on rafts.
The sheer manpower implies a powerful centralized government.

## 3. The Were-Jaguar
Their art is obsessed with a creature: Half-Human, Half-Jaguar.
Babies with snarling mouths.
Shamanistic transformation.
The Jaguar was the apex predator. Power. Night.
The Olmecs passed this Jaguar worship to the Maya and Aztecs.

### Fact Box
*   **Rubber People:** "Olmec" creates "Rubber People" in Aztec. They harvested latex from rubber trees. They made rubber balls for the ball game. They effectively invented vulcanization 3000 years before Goodyear.
