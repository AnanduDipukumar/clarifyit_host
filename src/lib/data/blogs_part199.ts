## Introduction: The Beautiful Boy
Narcissus was so beautiful that everyone loved him.
He rejected everyone.
Echo (a nymph who could only repeat others' words) loved him. He mocked her.
Nemesis (Goddess of Revenge) decided to punish him.
She led him to a pool of water.

## 1. The Reflection
He saw a face in the water. He fell in love instantly.
He tried to kiss it, but the water rippled and the face vanished.
He sat there, starving, waiting for the "Other" to love him back.
He didn't realize it was himself.
He withered away and turned into a flower (The Narcissus).

## 2. Narcissism Today
We live in the Age of Narcissus.
Social Media is the Pool. Likes are the Validation.
**Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)** is the clinical version: Grandiosity, lack of empathy, need for admiration.
The myth warns us: Falling in love with your own image is a form of death. You cannot connect with others if you are only looking at a mirror.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Narcissus** was a hunter in Greek mythology known for his beauty. After rejecting all romantic advances, he was cursed to fall in love with his own reflection. Unable to leave the beauty of his own image, he wasted away and died. It is the origin of the term **Narcissism**, describing extreme self-involvement to the degree that it ignores the needs of those around them.

## Introduction: The Theft
Zeus hated humans. He wanted to wipe us out.
Prometheus (Titan) loved us.
He climbed Mount Olympus, stole fire in a fennel stalk, and gave it to man.
With fire, we forged tools, cooked food, and built civilization.
Prometheus represents **Human Intelligence** defying Nature.

## 1. The Liver
Zeus was furious.
He chained Prometheus to a rock.
Every day, an eagle ate his liver.
Every night, the liver grew back (Immortality sucks).
It is the price of progress.
Every time we invent something new (Fire, Nuclear, AI), we suffer for it.

## 2. Modern Prometheus
Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is subtitled "The Modern Prometheus".
Oppenheimer is the American Prometheus.
The myth asks: Is knowledge worth the pain?
Prometheus says Yes. Even if the Gods punish you, it is better to be a human with Fire than an animal in the dark.
He is the patron saint of Science.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Prometheus** is a Titan in Greek mythology who defied the Olympian gods by stealing **Fire** from them and giving it to humanity. This act enabled human progress and civilization. For his transgression, Zeus subjected him to eternal torment. He symbolizes the quest for scientific knowledge and the risk of unintended consequences.

## Introduction: The Twilight of the Gods
The Greeks had no end times.
Christians have an Apocalypse where Good wins.
The Vikings had **Ragnarok**.
They knew that one day, the Wolf (Fenrir) would eat the Sun.
The Serpent (Jormungandr) would poison the sky.
Thor would die. Odin would die. The world would burn.
Evil wins.

## 1. Why fight?
This is the core of Norse courage.
If you know you will lose, and you fight anyway... that is True Bravery.
If you fight because you think you will win, that's just calculation.
The Vikings valued **Fatalism**.
"Cattle die, kinsmen die, I myself shall die. One thing I know that never dies: The fame of a dead man's deeds."

## 2. Rebirth
Ragnarok is not the end.
After the fire, the earth rises green again.
Two humans (Lif and Lifthrasir) survive.
Baldur (the Good God) returns.
It is a cycle. Destruction is necessary for creation.
It mirrors the ecological truth of forest fires.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Ragnarök** is a series of events, including a great battle, foretold to result in the death of a number of major figures (Odin, Thor), the occurrence of natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile. It represents the cyclical nature of time and the virtue of fighting inevitable doom.

## Introduction: The Labyrinth Escape
Daedalus was a genius inventor trapped in a tower.
He couldn't leave by sea (Minos controlled the navy).
So he controlled the air.
He built wings of feathers and wax.
He warned his son Icarus: "Don't fly too low (sea dampens the wings). Don't fly too high (sun melts the wax). Fly the Middle Path."

## 1. The Fall
Icarus took off. He felt like a God.
The adrenaline took over. He forgot the warning.
He flew higher and higher.
The wax melted. The feathers fell off.
He plunged into the sea and drowned.
Daedalus watched his son die because of his own invention.

## 2. Hubris
The Greeks called this **Hubris** (Arrogance before the Gods).
It is the story of every startup that grows too fast.
Every trader who leverages too much.
Every empire that expands too far.
Gravity always wins. The middle path (Golden Mean) is boring, but it keeps you alive.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Icarus** is a figure in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun with wings made of wax and feathers. His fall is the archetypal story of **Hubris** (excessive pride) and the failure to heed the wisdom of elders. It serves as a warning against recklessness and the limits of human ambition.

## Introduction: The Shame
King Minos prayed for a bull. Poseidon sent a beautiful white bull.
Minos refused to sacrifice it.
Poseidon cursed Minos's wife (Pasiphae) to fall in love with the bull.
She gave birth to the **Minotaur**.
It was a monster born of greed and unnatural lust.
Minos couldn't kill it (it was his son sort of), so he hid it in the **Labyrinth**.

## 1. Theseus and the Thread
Every 9 years, Athens sent 7 boys and 7 girls to be eaten.
Theseus volunteered.
Princess Ariadne gave him a ball of thread (Clew).
He went in. He killed the beast. He used the thread to find his way out.
Without the thread, killing the monster is useless because you die in the maze.

## 2. Jungian Psychology
Carl Jung saw the Labyrinth as the **Unconscious Mind**.
The Minotaur is your **Shadow** (The dark, repressed part of you).
You have to enter the maze to face your shadow.
If you ignore it, it eats your children (ruins your life).
The Thread is **Reason** or **Consciousness**, allowing you to return to the real world after confronting your demons.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Minotaur** was a creature with the head of a bull and the body of a man, dwelling at the center of the **Labyrinth**. It represents the primal, bestial nature hidden within civilization. The hero Theseus defeating it symbolizes the triumph of reason and order over chaotic instinct.
