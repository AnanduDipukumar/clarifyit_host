## Introduction: The Choice
Small Popcorn: $3.
Large Popcorn: $7.
Most people buy the Small. ($7 seems expensive).
Now add a Medium Popcorn: $6.50.
Suddenly, the Large looks amazing. "For only 50 cents more, I get a huge bucket!"
The Medium is a **Decoy**.

## 1. Asymmetric Dominance
This is the **Decoy Effect**.
The Decoy is priced to be obviously worse than the Target (Large) but better than the Competitor (Small) in one dimension.
It shifts your focus from "Do I want popcorn?" to "Which is the best deal?"
Companies use this everywhere (Apple Phones, Newspaper subscriptions).

## 2. Irrationality
It proves we don't have an internal "Valuation" for things.
We Value things by comparing them to other things *in the immediate environment*.
If you want to sell a $100 bottle of wine, put a $500 bottle next to it.
The $100 bottle suddenly looks cheap.

> **One-Minute Summary**

> The **Decoy Effect** (or Asymmetric Dominance Effect) is a cognitive bias where consumers change their preference between two options when a third, dominated option (the decoy) is presented. The decoy is designed to make one of the other options appear more attractive, often by being priced similarly but offering significantly less value.

## Introduction: The Booth
Sheena Iyengar set up a tasting booth in a grocery store.
Day 1: 24 flavors of Jam.
Day 2: 6 flavors of Jam.
Conventional wisdom says Day 1 (More Choice) should sell more.

## 1. The Result
**24 Jams:** 60% stopped to look, but only **3%** bought.
**6 Jams:** 40% stopped to look, but **30%** bought.
The limited choice sold 10x more jam.

## 2. Decision Fatigue
Too many options create anxiety.
"What if I pick the wrong one?"
The effort to compare 24 flavors is too high.
So the brain chooses the safest option: Default (Buy nothing).
This is **The Paradox of Choice**.
Less is more.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Choice Paralysis** (or Analysis Paralysis) occurs when an individual is faced with too many options. Instead of increasing satisfaction, an abundance of choice leads to decision anxiety, hesitation, and often results in no decision being made at all. The famous **Jam Study** demonstrated that simplifying options significantly increases conversion rates.

## Introduction: Reciprocity
If someone slams the door in your face (rejects a big request), they feel a little guilty.
If you immediately follow up with a smaller, reasonable request, they feel obligated to compromise.
You moved from $50 down to $5.
They move from "No" to "Yes".

## 1. The Study
Researchers asked students to volunteer as counselors for juvenile delinquents for **2 years**.
Every single one said No.
Then they asked: "Okay, will you just take them to the zoo for **2 hours**?"
50% said Yes.
(When they asked the zoo question directly to a control group, only 17% said Yes).

## 2. Contrast
It works due to **Perceptual Contrast**.
The small request looks tiny compared to the big one.
It is a core weapon of influence.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Door-in-the-Face Technique** is a compliance method where the persuader attempts to convince the respondent to comply by making a large request that the respondent will most likely turn down. The respondent is then more likely to agree to a second, more reasonable request, due to feelings of **Reciprocity** (concession) and guilt.

## Introduction: The Rival
Ben Franklin had a rival legislator who hated him.
Franklin wanted to win him over.
He didn't offer a gift (that looks like bribery).
He asked to borrow a rare book from the rival's library.
The rival felt flattered ("I am the guy with the rare books"). He lent it.
When Franklin returned it with a thank you note, they became friends.

## 1. Cognitive Dissonance
Why does this work?
Your brain thinks: "I did a favor for Ben. I don't do favors for enemies. Therefore, I must like Ben."
It rewrites your attitude to match your behavior.
Doing a favor for someone makes you invest in them.

## 2. The Trap
Be careful. This works for hating too.
"I hurt him. I'm a good person. Therefore, he must deserve it."
Treating people badly makes you hate them more.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Benjamin Franklin Effect** is a psychological phenomenon where a person who has performed a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person than they would be if they had *received* a favor from that person. The brain resolves the **Cognitive Dissonance** between the action (helping) and the feeling (neutrality) by deciding that the person must be worth helping (liking them).

## Introduction: The Quiz
A study showed people a video of a contestant answering quiz questions.
**Candidate A:** Answered everything perfectly.
**Candidate B:** Answered everything perfectly, but spilled his coffee on his suit at the end.
Who was more likeable?
Candidate B.

## 1. Humanizing
This is the **Pratfall Effect**.
Competence is intimidating. We envy perfect people.
But if a competent person makes a clumsy mistake, it breaks the tension.
"He's like me!"
It humanizes them.

## 2. The Catch
It only works if you are already competent.
If an incompetent person spills coffee, they just look like a mess.
You have to contain the *quality* first, then the *flaw* creates the charm.
(Think: Jennifer Lawrence tripping at the Oscars).

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Pratfall Effect** states that the attractiveness/likability of a capable person increases if they commit a blunder. The mistake makes them appear more human and approachable, reducing the social distance created by their superiority. However, for a person who is already perceived as average or incompetent, a blunder decreases their likability.
