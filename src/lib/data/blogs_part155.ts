## Introduction: The Insult
1874. Paris.
A group of rejects (Monet, Renoir, Degas) hold their own exhibition.
Claude Monet shows a painting of a foggy harbor: *Impression, Sunrise*.
A critic (Louis Leroy) laughs.
**"Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than this seascape!"**
He calls them "Impressionists" as a joke.
The name stuck.

## 1. The Science of Optics
Before this, Realists painted what they *knew*.
"A tree trunk is brown. A leaf is green."
Monet painted what he *saw*.
"The light is hitting the tree, so the trunk looks purple. The leaf looks white in the glare."
They realized the human eye doesn't see lines. It sees **patches of colored light**.
They used broken brushstrokes to mimic how light hits the retina.

## 2. En Plein Air (In Open Air)
Technology changed art.
In 1841, John Rand invented **Paint in Tubes**.
Before this, you had to mix powders in the studio. You were stuck inside.
Now, artists could carry paint outside.
They raced the sun.
They had to paint fast (Loose strokes) to capture the light before it changed.
This speed created the "Blurry" style.

## 3. The Shadow Conspiracy
Look closely at an Impressionist painting.
**There is no Black.**
Shadows in the real world are not black holes. They are violet, blue, or dark green.
They banned black from their palette.
It filled the canvas with vibration and light.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Monet's Eyes:** Later in life, Monet developed cataracts.
> His lens turned yellow. He couldn't see blue.
> His Water Lilies became dark red and muddy.
> He was painting through a filter.
> After surgery, he could see UV light (which is usually blocked). He started painting weird blue flowers that normal people couldn't see.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Impressionism** was a scientific revolution in art. By moving outdoors (**En Plein Air**) and painting quickly, artists like Monet captured the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere. They abandoned the "brown sauce" of academic painting for pure, unmixed colors, realizing that the eye perceives reality as a chaotic assembly of colored patches, not rigid outlines. They taught us to see the world as it actually is: vibrating light.

## Introduction: The Trauma
World War I broke Europe.
Rationality, Science, and Logic had promised Utopia.
Instead, they produced Mustard Gas and Trench Warfare.
The artists said: **"If Logic leads to this... we choose Madness."**
Dada was the protest. Surrealism was the philosophy.
Using Freud's Psychoanalysis to unlock the **Unconscious Mind**.

## 1. Salvador Dali (The Showman)
*The Persistence of Memory* (1931).
Melting clocks on a beach.
Why do they melt?
Because in a dream, Time is soft. It stretches. It has no power.
Dali called his method **"Paranoiac-Critical"**.
He would stare at a spoon until it looked like a woman. He induced self-hallucinations to paint them.

## 2. Rene Magritte (The Philosopher)
Magritte was different. He painted impossibly clean images.
*The Treachery of Images*.
A painting of a pipe. Underneath, it says: **"Ceci n'est pas une pipe."** (This is not a pipe).
He is right.
You can't smoke it. It is *paint*.
He forced us to question the relationship between the Image and Reality.
(Introduction to Simulacra).

## 3. The Shock
They wanted to shock the bourgeoisie out of their complacency.
*Un Chien Andalou* (Movie by Dali and Bunuel).
A woman's eye is sliced open with a razor blade.
It is visceral. It bypasses the brain and hits the nervous system.
It demands a reaction.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Anteater:** Dali was the ultimate eccentric.
> He arrived at a lecture in a Rolls Royce filled to the roof with Cauliflower.
> He walked his pet Anteater on a leash in the Paris subway.
> He claimed: "The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Surrealism** sought to liberate the human potential by bypassing logic and tapping into the **Unconscious Mind** (Freud). Artists like **Salvador Dali** used dream logic (Melting Clocks) to challenge our perception of reality. By juxtaposing unrelated objects (Lobster Telephone), they created a "spark" of absurdity intended to wake the viewer from the coma of rational, polite society.

## Introduction: The Shift
Before WWII, Paris was the capital of Art.
After WWII, it was New York.
The **Abstract Expressionists** (AbEx).
Jackson Pollock. Mark Rothko. Willem de Kooning.
They stopped painting "Things".
They painted "Feelings".

## 1. Action Painting (Pollock)
Pollock took the canvas off the wall and put it on the floor.
He didn't touch it with a brush.
He dripped paint from sticks. He danced around it.
**The Art is the Action.** The painting is just the record of the dance.
It looks random, but it isn't.
Mathematicians have analyzed his drips. They are **Fractals**.
They mimic the chaotic patterns of nature (Coastlines, Trees). That's why our brain likes them.

## 2. Color Field (Rothko)
Rothko went the other way.
Silence.
Giant squares of vibrating color.
He wanted you to stand 18 inches away and get swallowed by the Red.
"I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom."
People break down and cry in front of Rothko paintings. It is a religious experience without God.

## 3. The CIA Plot
This sounds crazy, but it is true.
**The CIA secretly funded Abstract Expressionism.**
Why? The Cold War.
The USSR had "Socialist Realism" (Paintings of happy tractors and strong workers). It was rigid propaganda.
The CIA wanted to prove that America was the Land of the Free.
"Look! Our artists are so free they can paint chaos!"
They set up a front organization (**Congress for Cultural Freedom**) to tour Pollock's work in Europe.
Pollock didn't know he was a cold war weapon.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Blue Poles:** In 1973, Australia bought Pollock's *Blue Poles* for $1.3 Million.
> The public was outraged. "A taxpayer drunk painted this!"
> Today, it is worth **$350 Million**.
> It was the best investment the Australian government ever made.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Abstract Expressionism** shifted the art world center from Paris to New York. It prioritized the act of painting (**Action Painting**) over the subject. Jackson Pollock's "Drip Paintings" captured the anxiety of the Atomic Age through controlled chaos, while Rothko's **Color Fields** sought spiritual transcendence. Ironically, the **CIA** covertly promoted this movement as a symbol of Western intellectual freedom against Soviet conformity.

## Introduction: The Reaction
AbEx was too serious. Too emotional. Too deep.
In the 1950s, a new generation said: "Lighten up."
They looked at the American Boom.
Supermarkets. TV. Ads.
**Pop Art.**
They treated a Soup Can with the same reverence as the Mona Lisa.

## 1. The Machine (Andy Warhol)
Warhol didn't have a Studio. He had a **Factory**.
He didn't paint. He Screen Printed.
He hired assistants to make the art.
"I want to be a machine."
He realized that in America, **Fame is a Product.**
Marilyn Monroe is not a person. She is a logo. Like Coca-Cola.
So he painted her like a logo. 50 times in a row. Mass production.

## 2. WHAAM! (Lichtenstein)
Roy Lichtenstein looked at trashy comic books.
He blew up a single panel to the size of a wall.
He hand-painted the **Ben-Day Dots** (the cheap printing dots used in newspapers).
He elevated "Low Art" to the Museum.
Critics hated it. "Is this the worst artist in the US?"
Now they sell for $100 Million.

## 3. The Meaning
Was it a critique of Consumerism?
Or a celebration of it?
Warhol said: "Good business is the best art."
He blurred the line between the Artist and the Brand.
He predicted our future:
**"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."**
(TikTok, Reality TV, Influencers). He was a prophet.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Shooting:** In 1968, Valerie Solanas (a radical feminist writer) shot Warhol in the chest.
> He technically died on the table. They revived him.
> He wore a surgical corset for the rest of his life.
> It made him even more obsessed with the flatness of death and fame.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Pop Art** collapsed the wall between "High Art" (Museums) and "Low Art" (Advertising). **Andy Warhol** and **Roy Lichtenstein** used the imagery of mass culture (Soup Cans, Comics) to reflect the American Consumerist dream. By using industrial techniques (Screen Printing), Warhol depersonalized art, treating Celebrity as just another product on the supermarket shelf.

## Introduction: Cabaret Voltaire
Zurich, 1916. Switzerland is neutral.
Outside, WWI is slaughtering millions.
A group of refugee artists gathers in a bar.
They are angry.
"If the 'Rational' world led to this war... then we will be **Irrational**."
They named their movement **Dada** (Hobbyhorse? Dad? Does it matter?).
They wrote nonsense poems. They screamed. They wore masks.

## 1. The Fountain (1917)
Marcel Duchamp went to a plumbing store.
He bought a porcelain urinal.
He turned it upside down.
He signed it "R. Mutt 1917".
He submitted it to an art show.
The Judges (who promised to accept *everything*) panicked. "This is not art! It's plumbing!"
They hid it behind a curtain.
Duchamp responded: **"I chose it."**

## 2. Conceptual Art
This was the Big Bang.
Duchamp proved that **Art is not the Object.**
Art is the **Idea**.
He invented the **Readymade**.
You don't have to *make* the art. You just have to *designate* it.
"Art is whatever the artist says is art."
This opened the door for everything we see today. If a banana taped to a wall is art... blame Duchamp.

## 3. L.H.O.O.Q.
He took a postcard of the Mona Lisa.
He drew a mustache and goatee on her.
He titled it *L.H.O.O.Q.*
Read aloud in French, it sounds like *"Elle a chaud au cul"* ("She has a hot ass").
It was a desecration of the Holy.
He wanted to destroy the worship of the masterpiece.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Chess:** Duchamp eventually quit art entirely.
> He spent the last 20 years of his life playing professional Chess.
> He said: "While all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists."
> He viewed the game as a pure sculpture of the mind.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Dada** was an anti-art movement born from the horror of WWI. It rejected logic, beauty, and skill. **Marcel Duchamp** revolutionized history with *The Fountain* (a urinal), inventing **Conceptual Art**. He argued that the artist's *choice* is more important than their *craft*. It was a punk rock rebellion 60 years before punk rock existed.
