## The Powerhouse Joke
We all learned it. "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."
But what *is* it?
It looks like a bacteria. It moves like a bacteria.
**The Shock:** It HAS ITS OWN DNA.
Your Nucleus has Human DNA (23 pairs of chromosomes).
Your Mitochondria has a tiny ring of bacterial DNA.
It divides on its own timeline. It doesn't listen to the nucleus.

## Endosymbiosis Theory (Lynn Margulis)
2 billion years ago, there was a big blob cell (Eukaryote) and a small energetic bacteria (Prokaryote).
The big blob tried to eat the small one.
But digestion failed.
The small bacteria said: *"Wait! Don't kill me. I can burn Oxygen to make energy for you."*
The big blob said: *"Deal. I will give you protection and food."*
They merged.
Every cell in your body is the great-great-grandchild of that failed lunch.

## Mitochondrial Eve
Sperm is tiny. It only carries Nuclear DNA (The Blueprint).
Egg is huge. It carries Nuclear DNA + Fluids + **Mitochondria**.
This means you inherit your mitochondria **Only from your Mother**.
Your dad's mitochondria fell off with the sperm tail.
This allows us to trace maternal lineage back perfectly.
We can trace all humans back to **Mitochondrial Eve**, a woman who lived in Africa 200,000 years ago. (She wasn't the only woman, but her daughters were the only ones whose line didn't break).

### Q&A
1.  **Can you have 3 parents?**
    Yes. **Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy.**
    If Mom has bad mitochondria (fatal disease), doctors take:
    *   Mom's Nucleus.
    *   Dad's Sperm.
    *   **Donor Woman's** empty egg (with healthy mitochondria).
    The baby has DNA from 3 people. It is legal in the UK.

## The T-Cell Paradox
Your immune system needs to kill *Everything that is not You*.
But how does it know what is "You"?
It learns in the **Thymus** (a small organ behind your heart).
It is a university for white blood cells.

## The Exams
1.  **Positive Selection:**
    The young cell is shown a generic "ID Card" holder (MHC).
    *   *Question:* "Can you hold this gun?"
    *   *Fail:* If it can't interact, it is killed.
2.  **Negative Selection (The Important One):**
    The Thymus cells have a superpower. They can print protein snippets from *anywhere* in the body (Eye, Liver, Knee, Heart).
    They dangle a piece of "Eye Protein" in front of the young T-Cell.
    *   *Question:* "Do you want to kill this?"
    *   *Fail:* If the T-Cell attacks the Eye protein, it is **Execuated instantly**. (Apoptosis).
    If we let that cell live, it would go out and attack your eyes (Autoimmune Disease).
**Graduation Rate:**
Only **2%** of cells allow.
98% are dangerous psychos that attack the self, and the body kills them before they leave school.

## Cytokine Storm (Friendly Fire)
Sometimes, the system panics.
During Spanish Flu or COVID, the immune system sees a new threat and screams "FIRE EVERYTHING!"
It releases **Cytokines** (Chemical War Signals).
The army floods the lungs.
They kill the virus, but they also fill the lungs with fluid and pus and dead debris.
The patient drowns.
The virus didn't kill you. Your own army's "Scorched Earth" policy did.

### Q&A
1.  **Why do we have Allergies?**
    **Hygiene Hypothesis.**
    Your T-Cells are bored.
    We killed all the worms and parasites.
    The army is standing around with nothing to shoot.
    So they see a Peanut or Pollen.
    One guy says: *"Hey, that Peanut looks sus."*
    They nuke the peanut. You go into anaphylactic shock.
    Kids who grow up on farms (with dirt and animals) have fewer allergies than clean city kids.

## The Peppered Moth (Classic Example)
1800s England. Trees were white (Lichen).
Moths were white (Camouflage). Black moths were rare (eaten by birds).
**Industrial Revolution:**
Coal soot turned the trees Black.
Suddenly, White moths stood out. Birds ate them.
Black moths disappeared.
Within 50 years, the *entire population* flipped from White to Black.
It wasn't a choice. It was a filter.

## The Petri Dish Mega-Plate
Harvard built a giant table (4 feet long) covered in agar jelly.
*   **Zone 1:** No Antibiotic.
*   **Zone 2:** low dose.
*   **Zone 3:** Medium.
*   **Zone 4:** 1,000x Lethal Dose.
They released E. Coli bacteria at the start.
In Zone 1, they thrived.
At the border of Zone 2, they hit a wall and died... until **One Mutant** appeared.
The mutant walked into Zone 2. Its children filled the zone.
They hit Zone 3. Paused. Mutated. Moved on.
In **11 Days**, the bacteria reached the center (1000x Lethal).
They had evolved into Superbugs right on camera.

## The Red Queen Hypothesis
*"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."* - Alice in Wonderland.
We invent Penicillin. Bacteria invent Penicillinase.
We invent Methicillin. They invent MRSA.
We differ Vancomycin. They differ VRSA.
Man is not winning the war. We are just staying in the race.
**The Post-Antibiotic Era:**
If we lose, a simple scratch from a rose thorn could kill you again (like in 1910).
Surgery becomes impossible (infection risk too high).
Chemo stops (immune system too weak to fight bugs without help).

### Q&A
1.  **Why don't we just stop using them?**
    We feed 80% of our antibiotics into **Livestock** (Cows/Chickens).
    Not to cure them, but because it makes them grow fatter faster.
    This creates a breeding ground for superbugs that jump to humans.

## The Scale Difference
Imagine a **Football Stadium**.
That is a Human Cell.
A **Bacteria** is a Football on the center line.
A **Virus** is a Marble inside the football.
They are not in the same weight class.

## The Definition of Life
To be "Alive", you generally need:
1.  **Metabolism:** You eat/burn energy.
2.  **Homeostasis:** You maintain internal temperature/conditions.
3.  **Reproduction:** You have babies.
**Bacteria:** Checks all boxes. It eats sugar. It divides. It is Alive.
**Virus:** Checks zero boxes.
*   It doesn't eat. It has no stomach.
*   It doesn't maintain temp.
*   It *cannot* reproduce alone. If you leave a virus on a table, it sits there like a rock forever.
It is a **Biochemical Machine**.
It simply floats until it bumps into a cell.
Then it injects its code. The *Cell* makes the babies. The Virus is just the blueprint.

## Why Antibiotics Don't Work
Antibiotics kill bacteria by targeting their machinery.
*   *Penicillin:* Destroys the tool bacteria use to build cell walls.
*   *Tetracycline:* Jams the bacterial ribosome.
**Viruses don't have walls.** They don't have ribosomes.
They are just DNA wrapped in protein.
Throwing penicillin at a virus is like trying to shoot a ghost. The bullet goes through.
To kill a virus, you have to destroy the *infected human cell* (which is what your immune system does) or jam the receptor lock (Antivirals).

## The Bacteriophage (The Good Virus)
Not all viruses are bad.
**Phages** are viruses that *only hunt bacteria*.
They look like lunar landers.
In Russia/Georgia, doctors use Phage Therapy.
If you have a Superbug infection that resists all drugs...
They inject a cocktail of Phages.
The Phages hunt down the bacteria, liquefy them, and leave your human cells untouched.
It is "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

### Q&A
1.  **Giant Viruses?**
    We found "Mimivirus" in melting Siberian ice (30,000 years old).
    It is huge (visible under normal microscope).
    It has so many genes it almost looks alive. It blurs the line.
    Scientists revived it. It woke up and killed an amoeba.
