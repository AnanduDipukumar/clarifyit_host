## Introduction: The Trap
10,000 years ago, we were Hunter-Gatherers.
We worked 4 hours a day. We had a diverse diet. We were tall and strong.
Then we started farming (Wheat).
Suddenly, we worked 12 hours a day. Our diet became 90% starch. We got shorter. We got cavities.
We got **Pandemics** (Measles, Flu come from farm animals).
Why did we do it?

## 1. The Ratchet Effect
Farming produces *more* food per acre, even if it is worse food.
More food = More babies.
More babies = You need more food.
You can't go back to hunting. There are too many people now.
You are trapped.
Agriculture allowed **Cities** and **Armies**.
The farmers (who were miserable) conquered the hunters (who were happy).
Quantity beats Quality.

## 2. Inequality
Hunter-gatherers can't hoard wealth (Meat rots). Everyone is equal.
Farmers hoard grain.
Now you have Rich and Poor.
Now you have Kings and Slaves.
The Neolithic Revolution created Hierarchy and Patriarchy.
It built civilization, but destroyed the individual.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Neolithic Revolution** (10,000 BC) was the transition from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture. While it enabled population growth, cities, and technology, some anthropologists argue it lowered the quality of life for the average individual, introducing malnutrition, disease, class stratification, and endless labor.

## Introduction: The Monopoly on Truth
In 1400, the Church controlled Knowledge.
Bibles were in Latin. Only priests could read them.
If a priest said "God wants you to pay me", you had to believe him.
Johannes Gutenberg invented **Movable Type**.
Suddenly, Bibles were cheap. They were in German/English.
People read them and said: "Wait, it doesn't say pay the priest."

## 1. The Explosion
Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses.
In the old days, the church would burn him.
But the printers copied his Theses thousands of times.
The Church couldn't burn the paper fast enough.
The **Reformation** broke the Church's power.
Then Scientists (Galileo, Newton) started printing their findings.
Knowledge became open-source.

## 2. Stability
The Printing Press destroyed stability.
It caused 200 years of religious wars.
Mass communication is messy (Propaganda, Witch Hunts).
But it is the foundation of Democracy.
You cannot have a Voter if you don't have a Reader.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Printing Press**, invented by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, introduced moveable type to Europe. By lowering the cost of books, it broke the monopoly of the elite on information. It catalyzed the **Protestant Reformation**, the Renaissance, and the Scientific Revolution, arguably serving as the most important invention of the second millennium.

## Introduction: The Black Ships
cmdador Perry (USA) sailed into Tokyo Bay with steamships.
He said: "Trade with us, or we shoot."
Japan realized they were behind.
The Samurai (Shogunate) wanted to fight with honor.
The Reformers (Meiji) realized honor doesn't stop cannonballs.
They overthrew the Shogun and restored the Emperor.

## 1. Copy Everything
They sent students to the West (Iwakura Mission).
"Copy the British Navy. Copy the German Army. Copy the American Economy."
They banned swords. They made Samurai cut their hair.
It was cultural suicide to save the nation.
"Japanese Spirit, Western Technology."

## 2. The Result
In 1905, Japan fought Russia.
Everyone thought the Europeans would crush the Asians.
Japan annihilated the Russian fleet (Battle of Tsushima).
It was the first time an Asian power defeated a European Empire in modern history.
The world was shocked. Japan had speed-run the Industrial Revolution.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Meiji Restoration** (1868) was a political event that restored practical imperial rule to Japan under Emperor Meiji. It marked the end of the Shogunate (Samurai rule) and the rapid industrialization/westernization of Japan. It transformed a feudal isolationist state into a global superpower in less than a generation.

## Introduction: 476 AD
We say Rome fell in 476 AD when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus.
But Rome didn't fall in a day.
It rotted for 200 years.
Edward Gibbon wrote *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* to answer Why.

## 1. The Causes
*   **Political Instability:** The Praetorian Guard auctioned the throne to the highest bidder. (26 Emperors in 50 years).
*   **Economic Crisis:** Rome stopped conquering -> No new slaves -> Labor shortage. They debased the currency (Inflation).
*   **The Huns:** Attila pushed the Germanic tribes (Visigoths/Vandals) *into* Rome. Rome couldn't fight them all.
*   **Christianity:** Gibbon argued that Christianity made Romans weak (Pacifism) and distracted them with the afterlife instead of saving the State.

## 2. Survival
Rome didn't die. It moved.
The West fell. The East (Constantinople) survived for another 1,000 years (The Byzantine Empire).
But the "Idea" of Rome—a unified, safe Europe—died.
The Dark Ages began.
Roads crumbled. Literacy vanished.
It serves as the ultimate warning: No empire is too big to fail.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Fall of the Western Roman Empire** was the process of decline in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, leading to the Dark Ages in Europe. Causes include barbarian invasions (Migration Period), government corruption, economic inflation, and over-expansion. It ended the ancient world and began the medieval era.

## Introduction: The Biome Merge
Before Columbus (1492), the Old World and New World were separate planets.
*   **America:** Corn, Potatoes, Tomatoes, Chocolate, Tobacco, Syphilis.
*   **Europe/Asia:** Wheat, Rice, Horses, Cows, Pigs, Smallpox.
When they met, it wasn't just people meeting. It was biology colliding.

## 1. The Potato
The Potato saved Europe.
It grows in cold, wet soil. It has high calories.
It allowed the population of Europe to explode (fueling the Industrial Revolution).
But it also caused the Irish Potato Famine when the crop failed.

## 2. The Great Dying
The exchange was uneven.
Europe got food. America got Disease.
Smallpox, Measles, and Flu killed **90%** of Native Americans.
It was an accidental biological apocalypse.
When the Pilgrims arrived, they found empty villages (The "Widowed Land").
They thought God cleared the land for them.
In reality, the germs had arrived a few years earlier.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Columbian Exchange** was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and diseases between the Americas and the Old World in the 15th and 16th centuries. It homogenized the world's biological landscape, creating the modern diet (Pizza, Curry) but devastating indigenous populations through disease.
