## Introduction: The Hidden Tax
In 1923 Germany, a loaf of bread cost **200 Billion Marks**.
People burned money for heat because it was cheaper than wood.
This is **Hyperinflation**.
But even "normal" inflation (2%) eats your life savings.
If you have $100,000 in a mattress, in 20 years it will buy $60,000 worth of goods.
Why do we allow this?

## 1. Supply and Demand of Money
Money is a commodity.
**MV = PQ** (Quantity Theory of Money).
*   M: Money Supply.
*   V: Velocity (How fast it changes hands).
*   P: Price Level.
*   Q: Quantity of Goods.
If the Government prints x2 Money (M), and the Factory output (Q) stays the same...
Prices (P) *must* double.
More dollars chasing the same number of toasters.

## 2. The Wage-Price Spiral
1.  Prices go up (Oil shock?).
2.  Workers demand higher wages to survive.
3.  Companies raise prices to pay the higher wages.
4.  Workers demand even higher wages.
This feedback loop destroyed the 1970s economy (Stagflation).
Paul Volcker (Fed Chair) had to raise interest rates to 20% to crush the economy and stop the spiral. It caused a recession, but it saved the Dollar.

## 3. Why 2% Target?
Why not 0%?
Because **Deflation** is worse.
If prices are falling (Deflation), you wait to buy a car. "It will be cheaper next month."
Everyone waits. Spending stops.
Factories close. Workers are fired. They spend even less.
It is a death spiral (Great Depression).
So Central Banks target a "Goldilocks" 2% inflation to force you to spend your money *now* before it loses value.

### Fact Box
*   **Zimbabwe:** They printed a **100 Trillion Dollar Bill**. It would buy three eggs. The inflation rate was 79,600,000,000% per month. They eventually deleted the currency and just used US Dollars.

## Introduction: The Nixon Shock
For 5,000 years, money was metal.
Gold. Silver. Or paper that could be exchanged for metal.
In 1944 (Bretton Woods), the world agreed: Every currency is pegged to the Dollar. The Dollar is pegged to Gold ($35/oz).
But America spent too much (Vietnam War + Welfare).
France sent a battleship to New York to collect their Gold.
The US didn't have enough gold.
On Sunday, August 15, 1971, Nixon went on TV: "I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold."
"Temporarily" became forever.
The world entered the **Fiat Era**.

## 1. What is Fiat?
"Fiat" is Latin for "Let it be done".
It is money by decree.
It has value because the Government says: "You must pay Taxes in this paper."
If you don't, you go to jail.
This creates inevitable demand.

## 2. Fractional Reserve Banking
Most money is not printed by the Fed.
It is created by **Private Banks**.
You deposit $100.
The Bank keeps $10 in the vault (Reserve).
It lends $90 to Bob.
Bob deposits the $90 in Bank B.
Bank B lends $81 to Alice.
$100 -> $100 + $90 + $81...
The "Money Multiplier".
90% of money is just numbers in a database created by debt issuance.
If everyone withdrew their cash at once (Bank Run), the system would collapse (It's happening? SVB).

## 3. The Cantonillon Effect
When new money is printed, who gets it first?
The Banks and the Government.
They spend it *before* prices rise.
By the time the money trickles down to the wage worker... prices have risen.
Inflation is a wealth transfer from the poor (last receivers) to the rich (first receivers).

### Fact Box
*   **Fort Knox:** Does it still have gold? Yes, about 4,000 tons. But the US Money Supply (M2) is $21 Trillion. The gold is worth $260 Billion. It backs 1% of the currency.

## Introduction: The Fed Funds Rate
Jerome Powell sits in a room. He says "5%".
The world markets crash.
Why?
The "Fed Funds Rate" is the base interest rate for banks to lend to each other overnight.
Every other rate (Mortgage, Car Loan, Credit Card) is built on top of it.
Fed Rate + Risk Premium.

## 1. Cheap Money (The Gas)
**Cut Rates to 0%:**
Borrowing is free.
Companies borrow millions to build factories.
You buy a house because the mortgage is cheap.
Stocks go up (TINA - There Is No Alternative to stocks which yield more than 0%).
Economy booms.
**Risk:** Inflation bubbles. (2021).

## 2. Expensive Money (The Brake)
**Raise Rates to 5%:**
Mortgages hit 8%. Nobody buys houses.
Companies stop hiring.
People lose jobs.
Spending drops.
Inflation cools down.
**Risk:** Recession.
The Fed's job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going.

## 3. Quantitative Easing (QE)
When rates hit 0%, the Fed can't lower them more.
So they use "QE".
The Fed creates digital money (out of thin air) and buys US Treasury Bonds and Mortgage-Backed Securities.
This injects cash directly into the banking system.
It lowers long-term interest rates.
Balance Sheet: exploded from $800B (2008) to $9 Trillion (2022).
Critics say this asset inflation fueled inequality.

### Fact Box
*   **Negative Rates:** In Japan and Europe (2015), rates went *Negative*. You had to PAY the bank to hold your money. The bank PAID you to take a mortgage. It was a desperate attempt to force spending. It barely worked.

## Introduction: The Invention
Before 1930, nobody knew how the economy was doing. "It feels bad."
Simon Kuznets invented GDP to help FDR manage the Great Depression.
$GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$.
*   **C:** Consumer Spending (70% of US GDP).
*   **I:** Investment (Factories).
*   **G:** Government Spending (Tanks/Roads).
*   **Net Exports.**

## 1. The Broken Window Fallacy
If I break a window:
You pay the glazier $100.
He buys bread. Baker buys shoes.
GDP goes up!
But... you *lost* a window. If you hadn't broken it, you would have the window *plus* the $100 to spend on shoes.
GDP counts activity, not wealth.
Disasters (Hurricanes, War) boost GDP because of the rebuilding money.
It is a flawed metric of happiness.

## 2. Per Capita vs Total
China (Total GDP) is #2.
China (Per Capita) is #70.
The average Chinese citizen is still relatively poor compared to the US citizen ($70,000).
**PPP (Purchasing Power Parity):**
A Big Mac costs $5 in NY and $2 in Mumbai.
$100 goes further in India.
Adjusted for PPP, China's economy is arguably already bigger than the US.

## 3. The Growth Trap
Why must we grow 3% every year?
Because we have debt.
If the economy shrinks (Recession), we can't pay the interest on yesterday's loans.
System collapse.
We are on a treadmill. We must run faster every year just to stay standing.
**Degrowth Movement:**
Argues we can't grow forever on a finite planet. We should aim for "Steady State".
Economists say: " steady state = poverty for the billions still trying to escape it."

### Fact Box
*   **Bhutan:** The only country that rejects GDP. They measure **GNH (Gross National Happiness)**. Forestry, Culture, Time Use, Psychological Well-being. They remain poor but content?

## Introduction: The Box
America buys $500 Billion more from the world than it sells.
This is the **Trade Deficit**.
Donald Trump hates it. "They are ripping us off."
Economists say: "Not necessarily."

## 1. Use of Funds
If I buy a TV from Sony (Japan) for $1000.
I have a TV. Japan has $1000.
What does Japan do with the dollars?
They can't spend them in Tokyo (they use Yen).
They have to spend them in the US.
1.  Buy US Jets (Boeing). (Exports).
2.  Buy US Stocks/Real Estate. (Investment).
3.  Buy US Debt (Treasury Bonds).
**The Recycling:**
The deficit comes back as Investment.
Foreigners own $7 Trillion of US Debt. They fund the US Government's spending spree.

## 2. Comparative Advantage (Ricardo)
David Ricardo (1817).
Even if Portugal is better at making Wine AND Cloth than England...
It should focus on Wine (Highest margin) and trade for Cloth.
Both sides get richer.
**Globalization:**
Specialization lowers prices. A T-shirt costs $5.
But it guts local indusry. (Rust Belt).
The efficiency gains are distributed to the Consumer. The Job losses are concentrated on the Factory Worker.
Result: Populism.

## 3. The Reserve Currency Privilege
The US can run deficits forever because the world *needs* Dollars.
To trade Oil, you need Dollars (Petrodollar).
To stabilize your currency, you need Dollars in reserve.
This "Exorbitant Privilege" allows the US to print money without hyperinflation (we export our inflation to the world).
If the Dollar loses reserve status (Dedollarization / BRICS), the deficit will matter. And it will hurt.

### Fact Box
*   **The Big Mac Index:** The Economist magazine tracks the price of a Big Mac globally to see if currencies are Overvalued or Undervalued. In Switzerland, a Big Mac is $7 (Franc overvalued). In Egypt, it's $1.50 (Pound undervalued).
