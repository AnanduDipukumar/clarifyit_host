## Introduction: The "Nutty" Idea
Look at a map. Brazil's curve fits perfectly into Africa's armpit.
It looks like a jigsaw puzzle.
In 1912, Alfred Wegener, a German meteorologist (not a geologist), said: "They were once joined."
He found identical fossils (Mesosaurus) in Brazil and Africa.
He found detailed rock formations that matched perfectly across the ocean.
He called the supercontinent **Pangaea**.
**The Scientific Reaction:**
Ridicule.
"How do continents move, Alfred? Do they plow through the ocean floor like ships?"
Wegener couldn't explain the mechanism (he thought maybe tidal forces).
He died in Greenland in 1930, considered a fringe scientist.

## 1. The Proof: Sea Floor Spreading
In WWII, Harry Hess used sonar to map the ocean floor (looking for U-Boats).
He found the **Mid-Atlantic Ridge**.
A giant mountain range in the middle of the ocean.
In the 1960s, we dated the rocks.
*   Ridge rocks: Brand new (0 years old).
*   Coast rocks: Old (200 million years).
**Conclusion:** The ocean is growing.
Magma rises at the ridge, cools, and pushes the old floor sideways.
It acts like a conveyor belt.
The continents don't plow *through* the floor; they ride *on* the floor.

## 2. The Engine: Convection Currents
Why does it move?
The Earth's core is hot (Radioactive decay + leftover heat).
The Mantle is plastic (gooey rock).
Hot rock rises. Cold rock sinks.
These massive slow-motion convection cells drag the crust plates on top.
Speed: 2 to 10 cm per year (fingernail growth speed).

## 3. The Collision Zones
What happens when plates hit?
1.  **Convergent (Himalayas):** India crashed into Asia. Both were continental (light). Neither sank. They crumpled UP. Result: Everest.
2.  **Subduction (Andes/Japan):** Ocean plate (heavy basalt) hits Continental plate (light granite). The Ocean plate slides *under*. It melts. The magma rises. Result: Volcanoes.
3.  **Transform (San Andreas):** They slide past each other. Result: Earthquakes.

## 4. The Future: Amasia
We are drifting.
The Atlantic is widening. The Pacific is shrinking.
In 250 million years, the Americas will crash into Asia.
A new supercontinent (**Amasia** or **Pangaea Proxima**) will form.
History repeats.

### Fact Box
*   **Wegener's Revenge:** At the moment Wegener died, he was technically right standing on two plates. Greenland is moving away from Europe. He is buried in the ice, drifting west slowly forever.

## Introduction: The Mystery
Jules Verne wrote science fiction.
But the reality is stranger.
Inside the Earth, temperature is 6000°C (hotter than the surface of the Sun).
Pressure is 3.6 Million Atmospheres.
It spins faster than the rest of the planet.

## 1. How do we know? (Seismology)
We can't drill there. The drill bits melt.
We use **Earthquakes**.
When an earthquake hits Japan, listening stations in America hear it.
**P-Waves (Primary):** Pressure waves. Imagine hitting a slinky. They travel through liquid and solid.
**S-Waves (Secondary):** Shear waves. Imagine shaking a rope. They cannot travel through liquid (liquid has no shear strength).
**The Shadow Zone:**
S-Waves are blocked by the center of the Earth.
This proves the Outer Core is **Liquid Iron**.
P-Waves deflect, proving the Inner Core is **Solid Iron**.

## 2. The Geodynamo
The Liquid Outer Core spins around the Solid Inner Core.
Moving Iron (Conductor) = Electricity.
Electricity = Magnetism.
This creates the **Earth's Magnetic Field**.
**Why we need it:**
The Sun shoots solar wind (Plasma) at us.
The magnetic field deflects it (Aurora Borealis).
Without the field, the solar wind would strip away our atmosphere (like it did to Mars).
We owe our life to the swirling metal ocean beneath us.

## 3. The Pole Flip
The magnetic poles are wandering.
North Magnetic Pole is rushing from Canada towards Siberia at 50km/year.
Every 400,000 years, the poles **Flip**.
North becomes South.
We are overdue.
During the flip, the shield weakens.
Result: Cancer rates rise? Power grids fail? Birds get lost? We don't know because civilization hasn't survived one yet.

### Fact Box
*   **Gold:** The Core is full of gold. If you could drag it all up, you could cover the entire surface of the Earth in liquid gold 1.5 feet deep. It sank there when Earth was molten because it is heavy (differentiation).

## Introduction: The Caldera
You go to Yellowstone National Park. You see geysers (Old Faithful). You see bison.
You ask: "Where is the volcano?"
You are standing on it.
The caldera (mouth) is 45 miles wide.
It is so big you can only see it from space.

## 1. The Hotspot
Most volcanoes are at plate boundaries (Ring of Fire).
Yellowstone is weird. It is in the middle of the plate.
It sits on a **Hotspot**.
A plume of magma rising straight up from the Core-Mantle boundary.
The North American plate slides over it.
Like a sheet of paper sliding over a candle flame. It burns a line of holes.
Idaho is the scar of previous eruptions.

## 2. The Eruption (VEI 8)
**Mt St Helens (1980):** Ejected 1 cubic km of ash.
**Yellowstone (640,000 years ago):** Ejected 1,000 cubic km of ash.
It is 1000x bigger.
**Impact:**
1.  **Immediate:** Everything within 100 miles is vaporized by Pyroclastic Flows (supersonic gas avalanches).
2.  **The Ash:** Wyoming, Montana, Idaho buried under 3 feet of ash. Roofs collapse. Concrete sets in lungs.
3.  **The Famine:** The ash blocks the sun for a decade (Volcanic Winter). Global crop failure. Civilization collapse.

## 3. Will it blow?
Probably not soon.
The magma chamber is only 15% molten (mush). It needs to be 50% to erupt.
But the ground is breathing.
The caldera floor rises and falls 3 inches every year.
Geologists watch it like hawks.

### Fact Box
*   **The Year Without a Summer (1816):** Mt Tambora erupted in Indonesia. It snowed in New York in July. Crops died. It led to the invention of the Bicycle (horses starved to death) and Frankenstein (Mary Shelley was stuck indoors due to rain).

## Introduction: Tight Oil
Oil used to be easy. Drill a hole, and it gushed out (Beverly Hillbillies).
That oil is gone.
The remaining oil is trapped inside **Shale** rock.
It isn't a pool. It is microscopic drops inside solid stone.
To get it, you have to break the stone.

## 1. The Process (Hydraulic Fracturing)
1.  **Drill Down:** 2 miles deep.
2.  **Turn:** Drill horizontal for 2 miles.
3.  **Blast:** Set off small explosives to crack the pipe and rock.
4.  **Pump:** Inject water + sand + chemicals at 10,000 psi.
The pressure shatters the rock.
The Sand (Proppant) holds the cracks open.
Oil flows out.

## 2. The Controversy
**Water Contamination:**
The "Frack Fluid" contains benzene and secret chemicals.
Industry says: "The rock is 2 miles down. Aquifers are only 500 feet deep. Thousands of feet of rock separate them."
Critics (Gasland) say: "Cement casings fail. Methane leaks into the water."
Viral videos show people lighting their tap water on fire (Methane presence).

## 3. Induced Seismicity
Oklahoma has few earthquakes.
After fracking started, Oklahoma had more earthquakes than California in 2015.
Why?
It's not the drilling.
It's the **Wastewater Disposal**.
Fracking pulls up messy salty water. They reinject it deep underground to dispose of it.
The water lubricates deep fault lines.
Slippery faults = Earthquakes.
Regulators now limit injection volumes to stop the shaking.

### Fact Box
*   **Energy Independence:** Fracking turned the US from an oil importer to the world's #1 oil producer (beating Saudi Arabia). It changed global geopolitics, weakening OPEC and Russia's leverage.

## Introduction: Fossil Water
Underground lakes (Aquifers) aren't always renewable.
The **Ogallala Aquifer** (Midwest US) was filled by melting glaciers 10,000 years ago.
It is "Fossil Water".
Once we pump it out for farming (corn), it is gone for 6,000 years.

## 1. Subsidence (Sinking Cities)
Water pressure holds the dirt up.
Remove the water -> The dirt collapses.
**Mexico City:** Sinking 20 inches a year. The Grand Canal lost its slope and now pumps have to push sewage uphill.
**Jakarta:** Sinking so fast Indonesia is building a new capital city (Nusantara).
**California:** The San Joaquin Valley has sank 28 feet since 1920. Telephone poles are buckling.

## 2. Saltwater Intrusion
In coastal cities (Florida), if you pump fresh water out, the ocean pushes saltwater in to fill the void.
Once an aquifer is salted, it is ruined forever.
Solutions:
**Toilet-to-Tap:** Recycling wastewater.
**Desalination:** Expensive boiling of ocean water.
**Cloud Seeding:** Making it rain.

### Fact Box
*   **Nestle:** Bottled water companies often buy land rights to springs and pump millions of gallons for pennies, selling it for $2/bottle. It triggers massive local protests ("They are stealing our rain").
