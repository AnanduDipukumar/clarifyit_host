## Introduction: The Silver Crisis
In 16th Century England, Queen Elizabeth I had a problem.
The old silver coins were pure.
The new coins (minted by her father Henry VIII) were mixed with copper ("debased").
By law, they were worth the same: 1 Shilling.
But in the market, the pure silver coins vanished. Only the junk coins remained.
Sir Thomas Gresham explained why.

## 1. The Mechanism
If two currencies have the same **Face Value** (Legal Tender) but different **Commodity Value** (Metal Content):
People will **Spend** the "Bad Money" (Debased).
People will **Hoard** the "Good Money" (Pure).
Why pay for bread with a pure silver coin if the baker has to accept the copper one?
You melt the silver coin and sell the metal for profit.

> **Mental Model: The Hot Potato**
> Think of Bad Money (High Inflation/Copper) as a Hot Potato. You want to get rid of it as fast as possible.
> Think of Good Money (Gold/Bitcoin) as a Cold Potato. You want to keep it in the fridge (Saving).
> Circulation is dominated by Hot Potatoes.

## 2. Modern Example: US Quarters
Prior to 1965, US Quarters were 90% Silver.
In 1965, the government switched to Copper-Nickel.
Overnight, the 1964 quarters disappeared.
You never see a 1964 quarter in change today. They are all in jars in people's basements or melted down.
Gresham's Law cleared the market in months.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Reverse Gresham's Law (Thiers' Law):**
> If the government *stops* enforcing the legal tender rate (i.e., you can refuse bad money), then **Good Money drives out Bad**.
> Nobody wants the junk if they don't have to take it.
> This is why Dollarization happens in failing economies.

## 3. Crypto Application
Is Bitcoin Money? or Gold?
People hoard Bitcoin (HODL). They rarely spend it on coffee.
People spend Dollars/Stablecoins.
According to Gresham's Law, this means Bitcoin is "Good Money" (Undervalued by the peg or simply too valuable to part with).
It acts as a Store of Value, while Fiat acts as a Medium of Exchange.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Gresham's Law** states that "Bad Money Drives Out Good." When a government forces two currencies to have the same face value, people will hoard the currency with higher intrinsic value (Good) and circulate the currency with lower intrinsic value (Bad). This explains why gold and silver vanished from daily commerce and why people spend depreciating fiat currency while holding appreciation assets.

## Introduction: Delhi's Snakes
British Colonial Rule in India.
There were too many Cobras in Delhi.
The government offered a **Bounty**: 1 Rupee for every dead Cobra.
At first, it worked. Thousands of dead snakes were turned in.
But the snake population didn't go down.

## 1. The Farm
Enterprising locals realized: "Why hunt snakes in the jungle? It's dangerous."
"I'll just breed them in my backyard."
People started **Cobra Farms**.
They raised snakes just to kill them for the bounty.
The British put a price on the snake's head, so the market **Increased the Supply** of snakes.

> **Mental Model: Second Order Effects**
> First Order: Pay for dead snakes -> People kill snakes. (Linear Thinking).
> Second Order: People want money -> People breed snakes to get money. (Systems Thinking).
> Policy makers often fail to see past the First Order.

## 2. The Crash
The government realized what was happening and cancelled the bounty.
The farmers now had thousands of worthless cobras.
They released them into the wild.
**Result:** The Cobra population was *higher* after the program than before.
This is the **Cobra Effect**.

## 3. Other Examples
*   **Hanoi Rat Massacre:** The French paid for rat tails. People cut off the tails and released the rats to breed more rats.
*   **Wells Fargo Fraud:** Management paid bonuses for opening new accounts. Employees opened 2 million fake accounts to get the bonus.
*   **"Use it or Lose it" Budgets:** If a department saves money, their budget gets cut next year. So they waste money on useless things in December to keep the budget.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Campbell's Law:** "The more any quantitative social indicator (like Test Scores) is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures."
> If you pay teachers based on test scores, they will cheat on the tests.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Cobra Effect** illustrates **Perverse Incentives**. When a solution incentivizes the problem (paying for dead snakes encourages breeding snakes), it inevitably makes the situation worse. It is a warning to policy makers: You get what you incentivize, not what you intend.

## Introduction: The Law of Demand Breaks
Standard Economics (Marshall):
Price goes Up -> Demand goes Down. (Negative Correlation).
Thorstein Veblen (1899) noticed an exception.
Some goods become *more* desirable as they get more expensive.
Designer bags. Swiss watches. Champagne.
These are **Veblen Goods**.

## 1. Conspicuous Consumption
Why do you buy a $50,000 Patek Philippe watch?
It is less accurate than a $10 Casio.
You are not buying "Time". You are buying **Status**.
The high price *is* the feature.
It signals to the tribe: "I have so much resources I can afford to waste them."
This is **Conspicuous Consumption** (Signaling).

> **Fact Box**
>
> **The Chivas Regal Effect:**
> In the 1950s, Chivas Regal Scotch was struggling.
> They didn't change the taste. They didn't change the bottle.
> They just **Doubled the Price**.
> Sales skyrocketed.
> Consumers assumed "Expensive = High Quality".

## 2. Giffen Goods (The Opposite)
There is another weird type: **Giffen Goods**.
Poor people buy *more* bread when the price of bread goes up.
Why?
Because the price rise makes them so poor they can't afford meat. So they substitute meat *with even more bread*.
Veblen = Rich People flexing.
Giffen = Poor People surviving.

## 3. The Limits
If you drop the price of a Veblen Good, you kill the brand.
If Ferrari released a $20,000 car, existing owners would be furious.
The "Exclusivity" would vanish.
Luxury brands destroy their unsold inventory (burn bags) rather than putting them on sale.
Discounting is death for Veblen.

> **Mental Model: Positional Goods**
> Some goods are "Positional". Their value depends on how many other people have them.
> A Degree from Harvard is valuable because few people have it.
> If everyone had a Harvard degree, it would be worthless.
> Veblen Goods are manufactured scarcity to create Positional Value.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Veblen Goods** (Rolex, Ferrari) violate the Law of Demand because demand *increases* as price increases. This happens because the goods serve as status symbols (**Conspicuous Consumption**). The high price functions as a costly signal of wealth, making the item desirable specifically because it is unaffordable to others.

        description: "Inflation is not uniform. When the government prints money, the rich get richer and the poor get inflation. Richard Cantillon explained why in 1730.",

## Introduction: The Injection Point
Imagine the government prints $1 Trillion.
It doesn't magically appear in everyone's pocket equally.
It enters the system at a specific point.
Usually: Wall Street Banks (Quantitative Easing) or Government Contractors.
Richard Cantillon (18th Century) realized: **Where the money enters matters.**

## 1. Early Receivers vs Late Receivers
**Group A (Banks/Investors):** Get the new money first.
Prices haven't risen yet.
They buy assets (Stocks, Houses, Gold) at the *old* prices.
Their buying pressure drives up asset prices. They get rich.

> **Mental Model: Honey Pouring**
> Imagine pouring honey onto a saucer.
> It piles up in the middle first (The Rich) before slowly spreading to the edges (The Poor).
> By the time it reaches the edge, the middle is already drowning in honey.

## 2. The Inflation Wave
**Group B (The Workers):** Get the money last (Wages).
By the time the money trickles down to wages, prices for Rent, Food, and Gas have already risen.
Their purchasing power has dropped.
They are paying the price for Group A's asset boom.
**The Cantillon Effect** is a wealth transfer from the poor (savers) to the rich (asset holders/debtors).

## 3. Why Reality Feels Different from CPI
The CPI (Consumer Price Index) says inflation is 3%.
But Housing is up 20%. Stocks are up 30%.
Why?
Because the new money flowed into **Assets**, not milk.
Asset Price Inflation is the shadow of the Cantillon Effect.
It widens the Wealth Gap without technically showing up in "Inflation" statistics until later.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **Cantillon Was a Genius/Scoundrel:**
> Richard Cantillon made his fortune betting against the Mississippi Bubble (which he helped inflate).
> He wrote the first treatise on economics (*Essai*) before Adam Smith.
> He died mysteriously in a fire (likely murder) before it was published.
> His theory was forgotten for centuries but is now crucial for understanding Central Banking.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Cantillon Effect** explains that **Money is non-neutral**. Changes in the money supply effect the economy differently depending on **who gets the money first**. Since new money usually enters via the financial sector, it inflates asset prices (Stocks/Real Estate) before it raises wages, effectively transferring wealth from wage-earners to asset-owners and increasing inequality.

## Introduction: The Seatbelt Paradox
If you give a driver a safer car (Seatbelts, Airbags, ABS), do they drive safer?
No. They drive faster.
Because the **Cost of Crash** has gone down.
They consume the safety benefit as performance.
This change in behavior due to protection is called **Moral Hazard**.

## 1. The Banking Crisis
A bank takes risks.
If the bet wins -> Bankers get bonues.
If the bet loses -> The Bank collapses.
But wait.
The Government treats the bank as "Too Big To Fail".
If the bet loses -> The Government bails them out.
**Privatized Gains, Socialized Losses.**
This incentives the bank to take MAXIMAL risk. Why not? You can't lose.

> **Mental Model: The Insurance Trap**
> Why do you lock your door? Because you don't want to lose your stuff.
> If you have 100% insurance that pays instantly... you might stop locking your door.
> You might even leave it open.
> Insurance naturally creates Moral Hazard. Companies have to use "Deductibles" (Co-pay) to force you to have *some* skin in the game.

## 2. The Principal-Agent Problem
Moral Hazard often comes from the **Principal-Agent Problem**.
The Agent (CEO) makes decisions for the Principal (Shareholders).
The CEO thinks quarter-to-quarter (Bonus). The Shareholders think decade-to-decade (Equity).
The CEO might take dangerous risks to boost the stock *today* and cash out, leaving the company to blow up *tomorrow*.

## 3. The Solution?
**Skin in the Game.**
Nassim Taleb argues that decision makers must suffer the consequences of their mistakes.
*   Roman Engineers had to sleep under the bridge they built.
*   Hedge Fund Managers should be invested in their own fund.
*   Banks should not be bailed out. Bankruptcy is the immune system of capitalism.

> **Fact Box**
>
> **FDIC Insurance:** Your bank deposit is insured by the government (up to $250k).
> This prevents bank runs.
> But it also means you don't care if your bank is risky. You just pick the one with the best interest rate.
> This forces banks to be risky to offer that rate. It creates a cycle of fragility.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Moral Hazard** occurs when an entity has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk (e.g., Insurance or Bailouts). It creates a misalignment of incentives, leading to reckless behavior (Banking Crises), and suggests that for a system to be robust, decision-makers must have **Skin in the Game**.
