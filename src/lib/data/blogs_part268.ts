## Introduction: The Fear of Paper
In the 1970s, inflammation was destroying the US Dollar.
Nelson Bunker Hunt and his brothers (Texas Oil Billionaires) were terrified their money would become worthless.
They decided to put their wealth into something real: **Silver**.
But they didn't just buy some silver. They tried to buy *all* of it.

## 1. Cornering the Market
By 1980, the Hunts controlled over **100 million ounces** of silver.
The price skyrocketed from $6 to $50 an ounce.
People started melting down their family silverware and tea sets to sell.
Jewelers (Tiffany’s) took out full-page ads screaming at the Hunts for destroying the industry.

## 2. Silver Thursday
Regulators (COMEX) panicked. They changed the rules overnight.
They declared "Silver Rule 7": You could only *sell* silver, not buy it.
Wait, what?
The price crashed instantly.
But the Hunts had bought on margin (debt). When the price fell, the banks demanded cash.
The Hunts couldn't pay. They went bankrupt.
It remains the most audacious attempt to corner a global market in history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Silver Thursday** (March 27, 1980) marked the collapse of the silver market after the **Hunt Brothers** attempted to corner it. They drove prices up 700%, but when regulators restricted buying on margin to prevent a total economic collapse, the price plummeted, bankrupting the brothers and shaking the global financial system.

## Introduction: The Odorless Market
Futures markets allow farmers to lock in prices.
In 1955, two traders (Sam Seigel and Vincent Kosuga) decided to lock in the entire US onion supply.
They bought 98% of the onions in Chicago.

## 1. The Dump
They controlled the market. They could set any price.
But instead of raising the price, they shorted the market (betting it would go down).
Then... they flooded Chicago with onions.
They shipped in onions from everywhere. They dumped onions in the streets. They threw onions in the river.
The price fell from $2.75 to 10 cents. The sacks were worth more than the onions.

## 2. The Ban
Farmers were ruined. They marched on Washington.
President Eisenhower signed the **Onion Futures Act in 1958**.
It is the only agricultural commodity in the US that is strictly illegal to trade on the futures market.
To this day, onion prices are volatile because there is no way to hedge the risk.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Onion Futures Act** (1958) is a unique US law banning the trading of futures contracts on onions. It was passed after a massive market manipulation scheme by traders Seigel and Kosuga, who cornered the market and then crashed it to profit from short positions, devastating American farmers.

## Introduction: The Bet
In 2008, hedge funds thought **Volkswagen (VW)** was doomed.
It was inefficient, debt-heavy, and the economy was crashing.
They "Shorted" the stock (borrowing shares to sell them, hoping to buy them back cheaper).
12% of all VW shares were shorted. This is dangerous.

## 1. The Trap
What the hedge funds didn't know was that **Porsche** (yes, the tiny sports car company) was secretly buying VW.
On Sunday, Oct 26, Porsche announced: "Surprise! We own 74% of VW."
Combined with the 20% owned by the government of Lower Saxony, only 6% of shares were available to trade.
But hedge funds needed to buy back 12%.
The math was impossible. Supply was 6%. Demand was 12%.

## 2. The Infinity Squeeze
The price went vertical.
€200... €500... €1,000.
Hedge funds lost $30 billion in hours.
For a brief moment, VW was worth more than ExxonMobil.
It taught Wall Street a lesson: Never short a company that is being bought by its boss.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Volkswagen Short Squeeze** of 2008 occurred when Porsche secretly acquired a controlling stake in VW. Hedge funds that had bet against VW (Shorting) were forced to buy shares to cover their positions, but there were no shares available. The scramble drove the price up 400% in two days, briefly making VW the world's most valuable company.

## Introduction: The Hoarding
During the Great Depression, people didn't trust banks.
They withdrew their cash and converted it to **Gold**.
This was a problem because the US was on the **Gold Standard**.
Every dollar had to be backed by gold. If people hoarded gold, the government couldn't print money to stimulate the economy.

## 1. Executive Order 6102
President Roosevelt dropped the hammer.
"All persons are required to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates."
The government paid them $20.67 per ounce.
Citizens were threatened with 10 years in prison if they hid their gold.

## 2. The Devaluation
Once the government had all the gold, they immediately raised the official price to $35.00.
They instantly devalued the dollar by 40% and made a massive profit.
It worked (it caused inflation), but it was arguably the largest government theft of private wealth in US history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Executive Order 6102** was signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, "forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates." It forced citizens to sell their gold to the Federal Reserve at a fixed price. This effectively ended the traditional Gold Standard, allowing the government to inflate the money supply to fight the Great Depression.

## Introduction: The Centennial Light
There is a light bulb in a fire station in Livermore, California.
It has been burning since **1901**.
It never burns out.
So why do your bulbs burn out every year?

## 1. The Phoebus Cartel
In 1924, the world's biggest bulb makers (Philips, GE, Osram) met secretly.
They had a problem: Their bulbs lasted too long (2,500 hours). People didn't buy enough replacements.
They signed an agreement to *reduce* the lifespan to 1,000 hours.
Engineers were ordered to make the filaments weaker.
They were fined if their bulbs lasted too long.

## 2. Planned Obsolescence
This was the birth of **Planned Obsolescence**.
Today, it is everywhere. Glued batteries. Un-upgradable software. Fast fashion.
The economy depends on us throwing things away.
If things lasted forever, GDP would collapse.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Planned Obsolescence** is a business strategy where a product is designed with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become obsolete (that is, unfashionable or no longer functional) after a certain period. Its origins trace back to the **Phoebus Cartel** of the 1920s, which standardized the lifespan of light bulbs to 1,000 hours to ensure repeat sales.
