## Introduction: The Cracks
On June 29, 1995, the **Sampoong Department Store** (Seoul's fanciest mall) was crowded.
Employees reported cracks in the ceiling. The building was vibrating.
The management turned off the AC (thinking the vibrations were from the fans).
They refused to evacuate the customers because they didn't want to lose the day's revenue.
At 5:52 PM, the entire 5-story North Wing pancaked into the basement.

## 1. The Cause
It was a textbook case of **Structural Failure**.
1.  **Change of Use:** It was designed as offices, but the owner (Lee Joon) forced the architects to change it to a department store.
2.  **Removal of Columns:** To make room for escalators, key support columns were removed.
3.  **The Roof:** They added a heated floor (ondol) and massive AC units to the roof, quadrupling the weight load.
4.  **Punching Shear:** The columns didn't have steel reinforcement caps. The floor slabs simply punched through the columns like a pencil through paper.

## 2. The Miracle
Rescuers worked for weeks.
11 days after the collapse, they found a man alive.
12 days after, a woman (Yoo Ji-won).
16 days after, a 19-year-old girl (Park Seung-hyun) was pulled from the rubble. She had survived by drinking rainwater dripping from the concrete.
The owner, Lee Joon, told reporters: "I lost my revenue too!" He went to prison.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Sampoong Department Store Collapse** (1995) was the deadliest modern building collapse until 9/11. Caused by gross negligence, illegal design changes (removing support columns, overloading the roof), and corruption, the disaster killed 502 people. It exposed massive safety lapses in South Korea's rapid economic boom ("Miracle on the Han River") and led to strict new building codes.

## Introduction: The Locked Door
The **Triangle Shirtwaist Factory** occupied the top floors of the Asch Building in Manhattan.
Most workers were young Italian and Jewish immigrant women.
On March 25, 1911, a rag bin caught fire.
The workers ran to the exit. It was locked.
(The owners locked the doors to prevent workers from taking breaks or stealing fabric).

## 1. The Fall
The fire escape was flimsy iron. It collapsed under the weight of the crowd, dropping 20 people to their deaths.
The elevator broke.
Trapped by the flames and the locked door, 62 women jumped from the 9th floor windows.
The firefighters' ladders only reached the 6th floor.
The nets tore when people hit them.
146 people died in 18 minutes.

## 2. The Legacy
The tragedy shocked America.
It led to the creation of the **Factory Investigating Commission**.
Frances Perkins (who witnessed the fire and later became FDR's Secretary of Labor) pushed for radical changes:
*   Mandatory sprinklers.
*   Outward-opening doors.
*   Panic bars.
*   Occupancy limits.
Every "Exit" sign you see today is there because of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire** (1911) was a pivotal industrial disaster in NYC. 146 garment workers died because factory owners locked the exit doors to prevent theft. The horrific sight of workers jumping to their deathsgalvanized the labor movement and led to the direct implementation of modern workplace safety standards and fire codes (NFPA 101).

## Introduction: The SS Grandcamp
The SS *Grandcamp* was docked in Texas City.
It was loaded with 2,200 tons of **Ammonium Nitrate** (fertilizer).
A fire started in the hold.
The captain didn't want to ruin the cargo with water, so he ordered the hatches sealed and **Steam** pumped in.
Steam puts out fire, right?
Not this fire. The steam heated the Ammonium Nitrate, turning it into Nitrous Oxide (laughing gas). The pressure built up.

## 1. The Blast
At 9:12 AM, the ship detonated.
It wasn't just an explosion; it was a nuclear-scale event (2-4 kilotons).
Thousands of people were watching the fire from the docks. They were vaporized.
The anchor of the ship (2 tons) was thrown **1.6 miles** inland.
The shockwave stripped the wings off two planes flying overhead.
It triggered a second ship (the *High Flyer*) to explode hours later.

## 2. The Chain Reaction
The blast ignited the nearby Monsanto Chemical Plant and oil refineries.
Texas City burned for days.
Estimates say 581 people died, but many were never found (vaporized).
It remains the deadliest industrial accident in US history.
It taught the world: Ammonium Nitrate is not just dirt; it is a high explosive.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Texas City Disaster** (1947) began with a fire onboard the SS *Grandcamp*, which was carrying ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The explosion triggered by the fire leveled the port, destroyed 1,000 buildings, and killed nearly 600 people. It demonstrated the extreme volatility of ammonium nitrate (the same substance used in the Beirut 2020 explosion) when confined and heated.

        description: "In 1981, two skywalks in a Kansas City hotel collapsed during a tea dance. 114 people died. The cause? A tiny change in a blueprint that nobody checked.",

## Introduction: The Party
The Kansas City Hyatt Regency was famous for its "Skywalks"—suspended concrete bridges crossing the atrium.
On July 17, 1981, 1,600 people were attending a Tea Dance.
Many were dancing on the bridges (2nd and 4th floors).
Usually, bridges can hold weight.
Suddenly, the 4th-floor bridge snapped and crashed onto the 2nd-floor bridge, crushing the dancers below.

## 1. The Design Change
In the original design, the 4th-floor bridge and the 2nd-floor bridge were supposed to hang from **Separate Rods** connected to the ceiling.
During construction, the steel fabricator suggested a change: "It's hard to thread a 40-foot rod. Let's use two 20-foot rods."
So they hung the 2nd-floor bridge *from* the 4th-floor bridge.
This meant the 4th-floor connection had to hold the weight of **Both Bridges**.
It wasn't designed for that.

## 2. Review
Calculations showed the connection could barely support its own weight, let alone a crowd of people.
It failed at the weld.
Nobody reviewed the change. The engineer stamped it without calculating.
Because of this disaster, Engineering Ethics laws were rewritten. Now, every change must be calculated.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse** (1981) was a structural failure in Kansas City that killed 114 people. It was caused by a subtle design change during construction: replacing single long suspension rods with a set of double rods. This effectively doubled the load on the connection point of the upper walkway, causing the nut to shear through the box beam. It is the classic case study in engineering ethics regarding the danger of unapproved design changes.

## Introduction: Monte Toc
The **Vajont Dam** in Italy (built 1959) was 262 meters high.
The engineers knew the mountain next to it (Monte Toc) was unstable. "Toc" literally means "rotten" in the local dialect.
They filled the reservoir anyway, believing they could control the landslides by raising the water slowly.
They were wrong.

## 1. The Slide
On October 9, 1963, at 10:39 PM, the entire side of Monte Toc (260 million cubic meters of rock) slid into the reservoir at 110 km/h.
It displaced the water.
A megatsunami **250 meters high** rose over the dam.
The dam held. It didn't crack.
But the water flew *over* the top.

## 2. The Air Blast
The wave was so massive that the *air pressure* in front of it leveled the village of Longarone before the water even hit.
2,000 people died instantly.
The dam is still standing today, intact but empty—a monument to hubris.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Vajont Dam Disaster** (1963) in Italy was caused by a massive landslide that fell into the reservoir of the world's tallest thin-arch dam. The impact generated a 250-meter-high megatsunami that overtopped the dam (which remarkably remained intact) and wiped out the villages below, killing nearly 2,000 people. It is a lesson in the importance of geological stability in engineering projects.
