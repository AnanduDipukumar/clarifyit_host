## Introduction: The Translation Movement
In 800 AD, Harun al-Rashid founded the **Bayt al-Hikmah** (House of Wisdom) in Baghdad.
He paid scholars weight in gold for every book they translated.
They saved the works of Aristotle, Plato, and Euclid.
But they didn't just copy; they innovated.

## 1. Algebra and Algorithms
**Al-Khwarizmi** invented Algebra (al-jabr). His name gave us the word "Algorithm".
**Al-Hazen** invented the Scientific Method and Optics.
They invented the Astrolabe.
It was the intellectual center of the world.

## 2. The River of Ink
In 1258, the Mongols arrived.
Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad.
They threw the books into the Tigris River.
Legend says the river ran black with ink for days.
The Golden Age ended, and the center of science shifted to Europe (Renaissance).

## Introduction: The Gate of God
Babylon (Iraq) was the capital of Mesopotamia.
**Hammurabi** wrote the first Code of Law there ("Eye for an Eye").
**Nebuchadnezzar II** built the Ishtar Gate (Blue Tiles) and the Hanging Gardens.
It was massive. The walls were so thick a 4-horse chariot could drive on top.

## 1. The Hanging Gardens
One of the 7 Wonders of the World.
Nebuchadnezzar built it for his wife, Amytis, who missed the green hills of her homeland.
It was an artificial mountain with waterfalls and exotic trees.
Archaeologists have never found it. Some say it was a myth.
Others say we are looking in the wrong place (Nineveh).

## 2. The End
Cyrus the Great (Persia) conquered it by diverting the Euphrates river and walking under the walls.
Alexander the Great died there.
Today, it is a ruin. But its legacy (Law, Base-60 time, Astronomy) lives in every clock and courtroom.

## Introduction: The Oasis
Jericho is in the West Bank.
It is the lowest city on Earth (below sea level).
It is an oasis in the desert.
People settled there in 9000 BC (Natufian culture).

## 1. Similarly, The Tower
They built a massive stone tower 11,000 years ago.
Why?
We don't know. Defense? Flood protection? Religion?
It proves humans were organized long before we thought.

## 2. The Bible
The Bible says Joshua marched around the walls, blew trumpets, and the walls fell.
Archaeology shows the walls *did* fall (likely Earthquakes).
Jericho has been destroyed and rebuilt 20 times.
It is the enduring symbol of human persistence.

Rome was a land power.
They fought 3 wars (Punic Wars).

Scipio Africanus invaded Africa.
He defeated Hannibal at **Zama**.
War over.

## 2. The Salt
Rome was paranoid. "Carthago delenda est" (Carthage must be destroyed).
In the Third War, they burned the city to the ground.
They killed and enslaved the population.
Legend says they sowed the fields with **Salt** so nothing would ever grow again.
It is the ultimate example of a "Total War" victory.

They were master hydraulic engineers.
They built dams and cisterns to survive in the desert.

## 1. The Treasury (Al-Khazneh)
The famous building you see in movies isn't a Treasury. It's a Tomb.
It is carved directly into the sandstone cliff face.
The architecture is a mix of Greek, Egyptian, and Assyrian.
It shows how connected the ancient world was.

## 2. Lost and Found
Trade routes shifted to the sea.
An earthquake hit.
Petra was abandoned.
Bedouins lived in the caves, keeping it secret.
In 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt dressed up as a the Arab scholar and tricked his way in.
