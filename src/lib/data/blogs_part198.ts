## Introduction: The Sketch
In 1957, Jørn Utzon won the competition to design Sydney's Opera House.
His sketch was beautiful. White sails billowing in the harbor.
But there was a problem: The curves were "Freehand".
Engineers (Arup) couldn't calculate the stress.
They tried parabolas, ellipses, circles. Nothing worked.
It was going to collapse.

## 1. The Orange Solution
One morning, Utzon was peeling an orange.
He realized: If you cut shapes from a single sphere, they all have the same curvature.
This was the geometry key.
By making the shells segments of one giant sphere, they could be mass-produced as pre-cast concrete ribs.
It saved the project.

## 2. The Legacy
Utzon was fired before it was finished (politics/budget overruns).
He never saw his masterpiece in real life.
But it changed architecture.
It proved that buildings could be sculpture.
It paved the way for the "Starchitect" era of Gehry and Hadid.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **The Sydney Opera House** is a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture. Designed by Jørn Utzon, its expressionist "shells" presented a massive engineering challenge. The solution (Spherical Geometry) allowed for the first use of computers in architecture to calculate structural stress, marking the transition from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age of design.

## Introduction: Spaceship Earth
Bucky Fuller was an eccentric genius.
He believed humanity was in danger of using up its resources.
He wanted "Ephemeralization" (Doing more with less).
His solution: **The Geodesic Dome**.
A sphere encloses the maximum volume with the minimum surface area (saving materials).

## 1. The Triangle
A square is weak (it can distort into a rhombus).
A triangle is strong (it is rigid).
A Geodesic Dome is a sphere made of triangles.
The larger you build it, the *stronger* it gets (proportionally).
You could theoretically build a dome over Manhattan (to control the weather) and it would hold its own weight.

## 2. Epcot and Antarctica
It is used in radar stations in the Arctic (Radomes) because it sheds snow and wind perfectly.
It is the icon of Disney's Epcot.
But it never became a house (The Dymaxion House).
Why? Leaking.
Triangles have too many joints. It is hard to waterproof a million seams.
It remains a symbol of a Utopian future that never arrived.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Geodesic Dome** is a hemispherical thin-shell structure (lattice-shell) based on a geodesic polyhedron. The triangular elements distribute stress throughout the entire structure, making it the efficient structural shape possible. Invented by **Buckminster Fuller**, it represents the ideal of affordable, sustainable housing for the masses.

## Introduction: The Greek Revival
Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers were obsessed with Rome and Greece.
They were inventing a Republic.
They didn't want the architecture of Kings (Baroque/Gothic).
They wanted the architecture of **Democracy**.
They chose **Neoclassical**.
The White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court.
They are all temples to the Law.

## 1. The Language of Power
Neoclassical style conveys:
*   **Permanence:** Stone columns say "We are here to stay."
*   **Order:** Symmetry and math say "We are rational, not emotional."
*   **Virtue:** It links the chaotic new America to the idealized past of Athens.

## 2. The Global Style
It wasn't just America.
Napoleon used it (Arc de Triomphe).
Hitler used it (Germania).
Stalin used it.
Dictators love Neoclassical because it makes them look legitimate.
It is the uniform of Authority.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Neoclassical Architecture** (mid-18th century) drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. Characterized by grand scale, simple geometric forms, Greek (Doric/Ionic) columns, and blank walls, it was adopted by the US to symbolize democratic ideals, rationality, and civic virtue.

## Introduction: Not a Box
Most houses are "Boxes in a Garden".
Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW) hated boxes.
He wanted "Organic Architecture".
The building should grow out of the land.
It should use local materials (Stone, Wood).
It should destroy the line between Inside and Outside.

## 1. Fallingwater (1935)
The Kauffman family hired him to build a vacation home.
They expected a nice view of the waterfall.
FLW built the living room cantilevered *over* the falls.
The sound of water is everywhere. The floor is the natural rock of the cliff.
It is widely considered the best American house ever built.

## 2. The Cantilever
He used reinforced concrete trays to "float" the rooms.
It was daring.
The contractors were terrified it would collapse. They added extra steel (secretly).
It is still standing (with some repairs), defying gravity and nature.
FLW taught us that a house is not a shelter; it is a frame for enjoying the world.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Frank Lloyd Wright** was an American architect who pioneered **Organic Architecture**, a philosophy promoting harmony between human habitation and the natural world. His masterpiece, **Fallingwater**, integrates the structure directly into the rising rocks and rushing water of the landscape.

## Introduction: The Death of the Grid
For 5,000 years, architecture was rectangles.
Bricks are rectangles. Beams are straight.
Zaha Hadid (The Queen of the Curve) changed that.
She used **Parametric Design** (Algorithms) to design forms that flow like water.
The Heydar Aliyev Center (Azerbaijan) has no sharp angles. It is a single continuous skin.

## 1. The Algorithm
You don't draw the building.
You define "Parameters" (Wind, Sun, Flow of people).
The computer "grows" the shape to optimize these parameters.
The result feels natural, like a bone or a dune.
It is impossible to build with blueprints. It requires 3D modeling and CNC manufacturing.

## 2. Is it Human?
Critics say it is "Alien". It ignores history/context.
Proponents say it is the **Style of the Information Age**.
Our networks are fluid. Our society is fluid.
Why should our buildings be rigid?
Parametricism is the first new global style since Modernism.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Parametricism** is an architectural style based on computer algorithms. Instead of assembling standard shapes (cubes, cylinders), architects use software to generate complex, fluid, and organic forms that adapt to environmental data. Championed by **Zaha Hadid**, it represents the shift from mass production to mass customization in construction.
