## Introduction: Le Web
Americans think the Internet started with the WWW in 1991.
But in France, millions of people were already online in 1982.
The government gave everyone a **Minitel** terminal for free (to save on printing phone books).

## 1. Proto-Apps
You dialed a number (3615).
You could chat, engage in "Pink Messaging" (Sexting), buy tickets, and check the weather.
It generated billions in revenue.
It was so successful that France was *slow* to adopt the real Internet because "We already have Minitel."

## 2. Legacy
It was shut down in 2012.
It proved that people wanted digital services.
It failed because it was Centralized (controlled by the Phone Company), whereas the Internet wins because it is Decentralized.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Minitel** was a Videotex online service launched in France in 1982. The terminals were distributed for free, creating a mass market for online services (e-commerce, chat, banking) long before the World Wide Web. However, its centralized, closed architecture eventually lost out to the open, global Internet.

## Introduction: Dial-Up
In the 80s, if you wanted to download a file (Doom.wad), you didn't go to a URL.
You dialed a phone number.
Your modem screamed at another modem.
You connected to a **BBS** running in some kid's basement.

## 1. Community
Only one person could be online at a time (usually).
You left messages on the board. You played turn-based text games (Legend of the Red Dragon).
SysOps (System Operators) were gods.
It was hyper-local. You only called local boards because long-distance calls were expensive.

## 2. The End
AOL and the Web killed the BBS.
But the culture of the BBS (Mods, Trolls, Warez) built the culture of the internet.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> A **Bulletin Board System (BBS)** was a computer server running software that allowed users to connect via phone line to upload/download files and post messages. It was the precursor to the modern social web, fostering local, hobbyist-run digital communities before the commercial internet centralized everything.

## Introduction: Newsgroups
Established in 1980 (before the Web).
**Usenet** is a decentralized network of servers sharing messages.
It is organized into hierarchies: *rec.arts.movies*, *alt.binaries.pictures*, *sci.physics*.

## 1. Innovation
Usenet invented:
*   **FAQs** (Frequently Asked Questions).
*   **Emoticons** :-).
*   **Spam** (Green Card Lawyers).
*   **Flame Wars** (Linux vs Tanenbaum).
Tim Berners-Lee announced the World Wide Web... on a Usenet group.

## 2. The Underbelly
Today, Usenet is mostly used for piracy (Binaries).
It is fast, secure, and uncensorable.
But the text archives (Google Groups) are a history book of modern thought.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Usenet** is a distributed discussion system established in 1980. Unlike the web, it has no central server; messages propagate between news servers. It established the vocabulary and etiquette of internet communication (FAQs, Flame Wars, Spam) and remains a massive, albeit underground, file-sharing network.

## Introduction: Structure
The Web (HTTP) is messy. Links are everywhere.
**Gopher** was structured. It looked like a file explorer. Folders and Files.
It was fast and clean.
For a few years, Gopher traffic beat Web traffic.

## 1. The Mistake
The University of Minnesota (who invented Gopher) announced they *might* charge a licensing fee for the server software.
Panic.
Tim Berners-Lee immediately announced that the Web would be free forever.
Everyone switched to the Web overnight.

## 2. Resurrection
A small group of hackers still run Gopher servers (The Gopherspace).
They like it because it is text-only. No ads. No tracking. No JavaScript.
Just information.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Gopher** was a protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. It offered a rigid, menu-driven interface compared to the Web's free-form hypertext. It lost the protocol war due to licensing fears, allowing the open and free **HTTP/HTML** (World Wide Web) to become the universal standard.

## Introduction: The Training Wheels
In 1995, the real Internet was scary. You needed Winsock and TCP/IP settings.
**America Online (AOL)** was easy.
Install the CD. Click connect. Hear the screech.
"Welcome."

## 1. The Walled Garden
AOL didn't want you to leave.
They provided their own News, their own Chat, their own Kids zone.
Curated content. Safe.
They charged by the hour.
At its peak, 50% of all US web traffic went through AOL.

## 2. The Merge
They bought Time Warner in the biggest merger in history. Or Hubris.
Broadband (Cable) killed Dial-up.
People didn't need AOL's "content" anymore. They just wanted the open web.
The Walled Garden fell... until Apple and Facebook rebuilt it 10 years later.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **AOL** (America Online) dominated the early consumer internet by providing an easy-to-use, curated "Walled Garden" experience accessible via dial-up. Its aggressive marketing (free CDs) brought millions online, but it failed to pivot quickly enough to broadband and the open web, leading to its decline from a tech giant to a legacy brand.
