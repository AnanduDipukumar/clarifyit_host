## Introduction: Grooming
Primates bond by picking lice off each other (Grooming).
It takes time. You can't groom 1000 monkeys.
Robin Dunbar (Oxford) correlated Brain Size (Neocortex) with Group Size in apes.
He extrapolated to Humans.
**The Number: 148 (approx 150).**
This is the max number of people you can maintain a stable social relationship with (knowing who they are and how they relate to everyone else).

## 1. The Layers
It's not just one number. It's circles.
*   **5:** Loved ones (Support clique). If you have trauma, you call them.
*   **15:** Good friends (Sympathy group). Dinner party.
*   **50:** Friends. You'd invite them to a BBQ.
*   **150:** Dunbar's Limit. You'd invite them to a wedding (maybe).
*   **500:** Acquaintances. You nod to them.
*   **1500:** Humans you can recognize by face.

## 2. Military Organization
Armies figured this out 2000 years ago.
A **Company** is usually ~150 men.
Why?
If a unit is < 150, you fight for your friends. You know everyone's name.
If a unit is > 150, you are strangers. Discipline requires bureaucracy and strict rank because "Social Shame" stops working.
**Corporations:**
Gore-Tex (the fabric company) splits its factories when they hit 150 employees. They build a new building next door.
They found that at 150+, "We" becomes "Them". Politics starts.

## 3. Social Media Illusion
Facebook destroys the physical limit (Grooming time).
But it doesn't fix the cognitive limit.
You have 1000 "Friends".
But you only interact with 20.
The rest are "Parasocial". You watch their lives like a TV show.
This creates **FOMO** and depression. You are seeing the "Highlight Reels" of 1000 people, making you feel inadequate. But you don't have the deep connection of the Inner 5.

### Fact Box
*   **Christmas Cards:** Dunbar analyzed who sends Christmas cards. The average household sends... 154 cards. The number is everywhere.

## Introduction: The Package
1967. Stanley Milgram (yes, the shock guy) sent 160 packages to random people in Nebraska.
Goal: Get the package to a specific Stockbroker in Boston.
Rule: You can only mail it to someone you know on a first-name basis of who might be "Closer" to the stockbroker.
**Result:**
The packages arrived in an average of **6 hops**.
"Six Degrees of Separation".

## 1. Hubs and Connectors
How is this possible? The world has 8 Billion people.
Networks are not random grids.
They are **Scale-Free Networks**.
Most people have few friends.
But some people (Connectors) have *thousands*.
If you pass the package to a Connector (e.g., a Politician, a Salesman, a Celebrity), they bridge the gap instantly.
You -> Your Boss -> CEO -> Senator -> President.
The "Hubs" shrink the world.

## 2. Kevin Bacon
This became a game. "The Oracle of Bacon".
Link any actor to Kevin Bacon via movies.
Most actors are within 2 or 3 steps.
Paul Erdos (Mathematician) has the "Erdos Number" (co-author distance).
**The Internet:**
With Facebook, the number has shrunk.
In 2016, Facebook analyzed 1.6 Billion users.
The average separation was **3.57**.
The world is getting smaller.

## 3. Viral Spread
This architecture explains Pandemics (and Viral Videos).
A virus doesn't spread linearly.
It hits a "Super-Spreader" (Hub).
One person in a Seoul nightclub infected 100 people.
Ideas spread the same way.
This is why censorship is hard. You can't just block the borders. The network has "Shortcuts" everywhere.

### Fact Box
*   **The Watts-Strogatz Model:** A mathematical model that proves you only need a few random "Long Distance" links (random friends in other countries) to turn a disconnected world into a Small World.

## Introduction: Strasbourg 1518
Frau Troffea stepped out and danced.
No music. Just convulsing.
She didn't stop for 6 days.
Others joined.
The authorities made a mistake. They thought: "They just need to get it out of their system."
They built a stage. They hired musicians.
This backfired. The music acted as a contagion.
It spread to 400 people.
15 people a day died of stroke/exhaustion.

## 1. Psychogenic Illness
It wasn't a virus. It wasn't Ergot poisoning (LSD mold).
It was a **Mass Psychogenic Illness (MPI)**.
The population was stressed (Famine + Syphilis + Religious Fear).
The brain converts extreme stress into physical symptoms (Conversion Disorder).
If one person twitches, the Mirror Neurons in others fire.
It cascades.
"It's a belief that becomes biology."

## 2. Modern Panic: The Tanganyikan Laughter
1962. Tanzania.
3 girls in a school started laughing.
It spread to 95 students.
They laughed for days. They couldn't stop. They were in pain.
The school closed. The kids went home... and infected their villages.
1000 people were affected. It lasted 18 months.
**The Salem Witch Trials:**
Girls convulsing -> Accusations of witchcraft.
Mass Hysteria often targets young women (high social cohesion/empathy).

## 3. The Nocebo effect of Media
Today, hysteria spreads via TikTok.
**"Tourette's TikTok":**
In 2021, doctors saw a spike in teen girls with tics.
They were all watching the same influencer with Tourette's.
They subconsciously adopted the tic ("Beans!").
It wasn't fake. Their brains rewired themselves to match the group.
Social Media is the new vector for contagion.

### Fact Box
*   **The War of the Worlds:** Orson Welles broadcast a radio play about aliens in 1938. People missed the intro. They thought it was real news. Panic ensued. Police stations were flooded. It showed the power of Mass Media to override reality.

## Introduction: The Cycle
1.  **Decay:** A neighborhood is poor. Rent is cheap.
2.  **Pioneers:** Artists/Students move in because it's cheap. They open cool bars/galleries.
3.  **Buzz:** It becomes "Hip". Magazine articles.
4.  **Developers:** Luxury condos ("The Lofts at SoDoSoPa").
5.  **Displacement:** Rent triples. The artists leave. The original poor families are evicted.
6.  **Sterility:** It becomes a generic outdoor mall for the rich.

## 1. The Argument For
"Revitalization".
Crime goes down.
Schools get better (higher property taxes).
Services improve (Whole Foods opens).
The city makes more tax money.
Someone owning a house there sees their asset value explode.

## 2. The Argument Against
"Cultural Erasure".
The community that built the vibe is exiled.
**The $5 Latte:**
It's a symbol. When a fancy coffee shop opens, it signals "This neighborhood is no longer for you" to the locals.
It breaks social networks. Grandma acted as the neighborhood babysitter. Moving her to the suburbs destroys that safety net.

## 3. Solutions?
**Rent Control:** Stops displacement, but discourages new repairs (why fix the roof if rent is fixed?).
**Inclusionary Zoning:** "If you build a luxury tower, 20% of units must be affordable."
**Community Land Trusts:** The community owns the land, not developers.
Nobody has solved it perfectly. It is the friction of Capitalism vs Community.

### Fact Box
*   **Anti-Homeless Architecture:** Look at park benches. Do they have a bar in the middle? That's to stop sleeping. Are there spikes on the window sills? "Hostile Design". It pushes the poor out of sight without solving poverty.
