## Introduction: The Glitch
Say "Fork".
Fork. Fork. Fork. Fork.
After 1 minute, it sound weird.
Is that a real word? It sounds like a nonsense noise.
This is **Semantic Satiation**.

## 1. Neural Fatigue
When you hear a word, a specific pattern of neurons fires to retrieve the *meaning*.
If you fire that same pattern over and over rapidly, the neurons get tired (Refractory Period).
They stop firing.
You hear the *sound* (Phonemes), but you can't access the *definition*.
It turns language back into noise.

## 2. Utility
It's actually useful.
Psychologists use it to treat phobias.
If you are afraid of "Spiders", saying "Spider" 1000 times can detach the fear from the word.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Semantic Satiation** is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds. It occurs because the neural pathways responsible for connecting the sound to the concept become temporarily inhibited due to overstimulation.

## Introduction: The Hidden Memory
George Harrison was sued for "My Sweet Lord".
It sounded exactly like "He's So Fine" by The Chiffons.
Harrison swore he didn't copy it.
The judge believed him... but fined him anyway.
"Subconscious Plagiarism."

## 1. Source Monitoring Error
This is **Cryptomnesia** (Hidden Memory).
You absorb an idea (read a quote, hear a melody).
You forget the *Source*.
Years later, the idea pops into your head.
It feels like an original thought.
You are plagiarizing your own memory.
It happens to writers and comedians all the time.

## 2. The Solution
It is terrifying for creatives.
The only cure is to Google your \"Original Ideas\" before you publish them.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Cryptomnesia** occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original. It is a memory bias whereby a person may falsely recall generating a thought, an idea, a tune, or a joke, not deliberately engaging in plagiarism but rather experiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration.

## Introduction: The Void
Try to remember your 2nd birthday.
You can't.
Most people have zero memories before age 3.5.
Freud called it **Infantile Amnesia**.
He thought we repressed the memories. He was wrong.

## 1. Neurogenesis
The Hippocampus (the memory recorder) is fully developed at birth.
Babies *can* form memories.
But... they are growing *too many* new neurons (Neurogenesis).
The brain is rewiring itself so fast that the old connections get overwritten.
It's like formatting a hard drive while trying to save a file.

## 2. Language
Also, we encode memories in narratives (Words).
Before you have language, you don't have the "files" to store a story.
You have feelings (Warmth, Hunger), but not "Events".

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Childhood Amnesia** is the inability of adults to retrieve episodic memories (memories of situations or events) before the age of two to four years. Current theories suggest it is caused by the rapid rate of **Neurogenesis** in the developing hippocampus, which disrupts existing memory networks, and the lack of language skills required to encode complex narratives.

## Introduction: The Graph
If you plot \"Vivid Memories\" vs \"Age\", it isn't a flat line.
There is a huge spike between ages 15 and 25.
This is the **Reminiscence Bump**.

## 1. Firsts
Why? Because that decade is full of **Firsts**.
First Kiss. First Car. First Job. College. Marriage.
Novelty creates strong memories.
Life after 30 (Routine) blurs together ("The Commuter Effect").
10 years of driving to the same office becomes one single memory.

## 2. Identity Formation
Also, that is the decade you decide *Who You Are*.
The music you listen to at 17 becomes "Your Music" forever.
Nostalgia isn't random; it's anchored to your identity.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Reminiscence Bump** is the tendency for older adults to have increased recollection for events that occurred during their adolescence and early adulthood (approximately ages 15–25). This is attributed to the novelty of experiences (the "firsts") and the fact that this period is critical for **Identity Formation**.

## Introduction: Content vs Context
The brain stores Facts (**Semantic Memory**) separately from Context (**Episodic Memory**).
You remember *that* Paris is the capital of France.
You don't remember *when* you learned it.

## 1. The Sleeper Effect
You read a tabloid headline: "Alien Baby Born in Hospital!"
You laugh. You know it's fake.
6 months later... the *Source* fades.
But the *Fact* remains loosely connected in your brain ("Alien... Baby... Hospital...").
Suddenly, you think: "didn't I hear about an alien baby somewhere?"
It starts to feel like a real memory.

## 2. Weaponized
Propaganda uses this.
Even if you debunk a lie immediately, the brain remembers the lie but forgets the debunking over time.
"Slander leaves a scar."

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Source Amnesia** is the inability to remember where, when, or how previously learned information has been acquired, while retaining the factual knowledge. This dissociation between the content and the source allows misinformation to become credible over time, a phenomenon known as the **Sleeper Effect**.
