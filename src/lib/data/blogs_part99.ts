## Introduction: The Lemon Juice Man
McArthur Wheeler robbed two banks.
He wore no mask. He smiled at the cameras.
When caught, he said: "But I wore the juice."
He thought lemon juice (invisible ink) would make his face invisible to cameras.
He wasn't crazy. He was just incredibly wrong.
Dunning & Kruger studied him.
Conclusion: "The skills needed to be competent are the same skills needed to *recognize* competence."

## 1. The Curve
*   **Mount Stupid:** You learn a little bit. You think you know everything. Confidence 100%. "Vaccines cause autism!"
*   **Valley of Despair:** You learn more. You realize how complex it is. Confidence drops to 0%. "I know nothing."
*   **Slope of Enlightenment:** You slowly gain real expertise. Confidence rises, but never reaches 100% again.
Experts are humble because they know the *Unknown Unknowns*.

## 2. Imposter Syndrome
The opposite.
Smart people assume everyone else is smart too.
"This is easy for me, so it must be easy for everyone."
They feel like frauds.
Real experts usually underestimate themselves.

## 3. The Internet Effect
Google makes Dunning-Kruger worse.
"I read the headline."
We mistake **Access to Information** for **Understanding**.
Just because you have a library in your pocket doesn't mean you are a librarian.
It creates a society of arrogant amateurs.

### Fact Box
*   **Driver Survey:** 80% of drivers rate themselves as "Above Average". This is mathematically impossible. We are all biased to think we are better than we are.

## Introduction: The Data
WWII. Planes come back with holes in the wings and tail.
The Generals said: "Put more armor on the wings."
Abraham Wald (Mathematician) said: "NO. Put armor on the engines."
Why?
"The planes with holes in the engine... **didn't come back**."
You are only looking at the survivors. The holes you see are the non-fatal ones.

## 1. Business Gurus
"Bill Gates dropped out of college. Mark Zuckerberg dropped out. Therefore, college is a waste of time."
Survivorship Bias.
You don't see the 10,000 dropouts who failed and are working at McDonald's.
We study the Winners and ignore the Losers.
This distorts our "Formula for Success".

## 2. Music Was Better Back Then
"The 70s had Queen and Led Zeppelin. Today we have mumble rap."
Bias.
The 70s also had terrible music.
But we forgot it. It didn't survive.
We only remember the hits.
Selection bias makes the past look golden.

## 3. The Lottery
We see the winner on TV holding the giant check.
We don't see the 10 million losers holding crumpled tickets.
If the news showed every loser for 10 seconds... the show would last 3 years.
We overestimate our chances because we only see the wins.

### Fact Box
*   **The Cat:** There is a myth that cats surviving high falls (10 stories) have fewer injuries than cats falling from low heights (3 stories). Why? Because the cats that die from 10 stories are not taken to the vet, so they aren't in the dataset.

## Introduction: The Concorde
The Concorde jet was a financial disaster.
Governments knew it would never make a profit.
But they kept funding it for 30 years.
Why? "We have already spent Billions. We can't stop now."
Wait... The money is gone. It is **Sunk**.
The decision should only be about *future* costs vs benefits.
Past costs are irrelevant.

## 1. Relationships
"We have been together for 5 years. I can't break up now."
If the next 5 years will be miserable... you should break up.
The 5 years you spent are "Sunk". You can't get them back.
Don't spend 5 *more* bad years just to justify the first 5.

## 2. Loss Aversion
Kahneman & Tversky.
The pain of losing $100 is 2x stronger than the joy of winning $100.
We hate admitting loss.
Admitting a project failed feels like wasting the money.
Continuing the project feels like "Hope".
So we dig the hole deeper.

## 3. The Buffet Effect
"All You Can Eat".
You are full. It hurts to eat more.
But you eat anyway "to get your money's worth".
You are paying twice: Once with money, once with a stomach ache.
Logic: Listen to your body, ignore the wallet.

### Fact Box
*   **The Ticket:** You lose a $100 ticket to a concert. Do you buy another one? Most say No. Situation B: You lose $100 cash. Do you buy a ticket? Most say Yes. Economically, it is the same loss ($100). But we frame it differently.

## Introduction: The Filter Bubble
You believe the Earth is Flat.
You Google: "Flat earth proof".
Google shows you 100 videos proving it.
You ignore the 1,000,000 videos disproving it.
"See? The internet agrees with me."
Confirmation Bias + Algorithm = Radicalization.

## 1. The Backfire Effect
If you show a conspiracy theorist facts that prove them wrong...
They don't change their mind.
They double down.
"The evidence is fake! It's part of the conspiracy!"
Challenging a core belief triggers the **Amygdala** (Fight or Flight).
They feel physically attacked.

## 2. Horoscope Effect (Barnum Effect)
"You are a kind person, but sometimes you are critical."
"OMG that is SO me!"
It applies to everyone.
We pick the parts that fit and ignore the parts that don't.
We seek validation, not accuracy.

## 3. Science is the Antidote
The Scientific Method is designed *specifically* to break Confirmation Bias.
Falsifiability (Karl Popper).
You don't try to prove your theory right.
You try to **prove it wrong**.
If you fail to prove it wrong... then maybe it's right.
Most people do the opposite.

### Fact Box
*   **The Wason Selection Task:** A logic puzzle with cards. 90% of people get it wrong because they look for cards that confirm the rule, not the card that would break the rule.

## Introduction: The Steve Jobs Trick
Steve Jobs announces the iPad.
"Analysts say it should cost **$999**." (A giant $999 appears on screen).
He lets it sit there. The audience Anchors to $999.
"But actually... it's **$499**."
The crowd goes wild. "It's a bargain!"
If he started with $499, they would have said "Expensive".
But compared to the Anchor ($999), it feels cheap.

## 1. The Menu
A restaurant puts a $100 Wagyu Steak at the top of the menu.
You probably won't buy it.
But suddenly, the $35 Ribeye looks reasonable.
"I'm saving money by not getting the Wagyu."
The $100 steak is a Decoy. Its job isn't to be eaten; its job is to make the other steaks look cheap.

## 2. Salary Negotiation
Who says the number first?
You or the Boss?
Correct Answer: **You**.
Anchor High.
"I want $150k."
Boss: "That's crazy! We can only do $120k."
You win. (They were planning $100k).
The final number usually settles near the Anchor.

## 3. Random Numbers
Tversky & Kahneman spun a wheel of fortune (landing on 10 or 65).
Then asked: "What percentage of African nations are in the UN?"
People who saw 10 guessed low (~25%).
People who saw 65 guessed high (~45%).
The random number *influenced their geography estimate*.
Our brain clings to *any* number available when we are uncertain.

### Fact Box
*   **Gas Prices:** When gas goes from $4.00 to $3.50, we feel happy. "It's cheap!" But $3.50 is historically high. We are anchored to the recent peak.
