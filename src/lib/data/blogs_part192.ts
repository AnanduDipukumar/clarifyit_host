## Introduction: The Perfect Preservation
Most ancient cities were looted, rebuilt, or rotted away.
Pompeii is unique.
A blanket of volcanic ash buried it 20 feet deep in minutes.
It locked out the oxygen.
Bread is still in the ovens. Paint is still on the walls. The grafitti is still fresh.
It is a time capsule.

## 1. The Plaster Casts
When archaeologists excavated, they found hollow voids in the ash.
Giuseppe Fiorelli (1863) had an idea: Pour plaster into the holes.
When the plaster hardened, he chipped away the ash.
The result was terrifying.
**Statues of the dead.**
You can see their facial expressions. Mothers hugging children. Dogs twisting in pain.
We aren't looking at skeletons. We are looking at the exact moment of their death.

## 2. Roman Life
Pompeii reveals that Romans were just like us.
*   **Fast Food:** There are "Thermopoliums" (Snack bars) on every corner.
*   **Graffiti:** "Lucilla made money here." "Oppius is a clown." "Gaius loves Pompeia."
*   **Beware of Dog:** A mosaic floor literally says "Cave Canem".
It humanizes history.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Pompeii** was an ancient Roman city buried under volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of **Mount Vesuvius** in 79 AD. The rapid burial preserved the city in unique detail, providing an unparalleled snapshot of Roman daily life, from frescoed villas to brothels and political slogans.

## Introduction: The Emperor's Escort
Qin Shi Huang (First Emperor of China) was terrified of death.
He spent his life looking for the Elixir of Life (and died drinking mercury).
He built a massive tomb to rule in the afterlife.
He didn't want to go alone.
But he didn't want to kill 8,000 real soldiers (Human Sacrifice was going out of style).
So he built them out of clay.

## 1. Mass Production
8,000 soldiers. 130 chariots. 670 horses.
It was an industrial miracle.
They used assembly lines. Arms made here. Legs made there.
But the **Heads** are unique.
Some have mustaches. Some are young. Some are old.
It is believed they modeled them after real soldiers.
They were originally painted in bright colors (Purple, Red, Green), but the paint flaked off when exposed to air in 1974.

## 2. The Mercury River
The Army is just the perimeter.
The Emperor's actual tomb has never been opened.
Ancient texts say it contains a map of China with rivers made of **Flowing Mercury**.
Soil samples nearby show insanely high levels of mercury.
Archaeologists are afraid to open it.
1. Booby traps (Crossbows).
2. The mercury gas would kill them.
3. Air would destroy the artifacts.
The Emperor is still sleeping.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Terracotta Army** is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of **Qin Shi Huang**, the first Emperor of China. Buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE to protect him in his afterlife, the figures include warriors, chariots, and horses. It is considered one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century.

## Introduction: The Essenes
1947. Qumran Caves (West Bank).
Bedouin shepherds find jars containing 981 texts.
They were written between 150 BC and 70 AD.
They include parts of every book of the Hebrew Bible (except Esther).
They were hidden by a Jewish sect called the **Essenes** before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem.

## 1. Why it matters
Before this, our oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible was from **1000 AD** (Aleppo Codex).
This pushed the history back **1,000 years**.
Scholars were terrified. "What if the Bible has changed?" "What if the monks made mistakes?"
They compared the scrolls to the modern Bible.
It was 95% identical.
The oral and written tradition had remained incredibly pure for a millennium.

## 2. The Copper Scroll
One scroll wasn't paper. It was Copper.
It is a Treasure Map.
It lists 64 locations of hidden gold and silver.
"In the fortress which is in the Vale of Achor, forty cubits under the steps... a chest of silver."
People have been looking for 50 years. Nobody has found the gold.
Maybe the Romans got it. Maybe it's still there.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Dead Sea Scrolls** are ancient Jewish religious manuscripts found in the Qumran Caves in the Judaean Desert. They date from the last three centuries BCE and the first century CE. They provide crucial insights into the history of Judaism and the background of Christianity, confirming the accuracy of the biblical text over history.

## Introduction: The Geoglyphs
The Nazca Desert (Peru) is dry and windless.
Between 500 BC and 500 AD, the Nazca people removed the red pebbles from the surface to reveal the white lime soil underneath.
They drew lines.
Some are straight lines for miles.
Some are shapes (Geoglyphs).
A Monkey (300 ft). A Condor (440 ft). A Spider.

## 1. The Perspective Problem
They could not fly.
How did they draw perfect shapes that can only be appreciated from 1,000 feet up?
Some say Aliens (Von Daniken).
Science says Math.
They likely used basic surveying tools (stakes and ropes) to scale up small drawings.
It was a feat of engineering, not magic.

## 2. Why?
Why do it if you can't see it?
1.  **Water Cult:** The lines map underground aquifers or point to water sources (The desert is dry).
2.  **Astronomy:** They align with stars or solstices.
3.  **Gods:** The intended audience was not humans. It was the Sky Gods. They were walking paths for religious processions to pray for rain.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The **Nazca Lines** are a group of very large geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. Created between 500 BCE and 500 CE, they depict various plants, animals, and straight lines. Their purpose remains debated, but most scholars believe they served **religious** or **astronomical** functions, possibly related to water rituals.

## Introduction: The Gold
1922. The Valley of the Kings.
Every tomb had been robbed in antiquity.
Howard Carter found a sealed door hidden under debris.
He made a tiny hole. Lord Carnarvon asked: "Can you see anything?"
Carter replied: **"Yes, wonderful things."**
Glittering gold. Chariots. The Sarcophagus.
King Tut was a minor Pharoah (died at 19). If *his* tomb was this rich, imagine what Ramses II had.

## 1. The Curse
Lord Carnarvon died 4 months later. Mosquito bite -> Infection.
The lights in Cairo supposedly flickered out when he died.
The media went crazy: "THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY."
In reality, Carter lived for another 17 years.
Most of the team lived long lives.
But the legend of the curse sold millions of newspapers.

## 2. What it taught us
We learned about the **Book of the Dead**.
We learned about mummification.
We learned that Egyptians believed you *could* take it with you.
They packed food, wine, board games (Senet), and underwear for the afterlife.
Death wasn't the end. It was a road trip.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> The discovery of **Tutankhamun's Tomb** (KV62) by Howard Carter in 1922 was the most famous find in the history of Egyptology. It was the first intact royal tomb ever found, revealing the immense wealth of the Pharaohs. The media frenzy surrounding the "Curse of the Pharaohs" cemented it in pop culture.
