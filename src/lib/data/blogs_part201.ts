## Introduction: The Rediscovery
In 1880, Francis Galton noticed some people couldn't visualize.
Nobody believed him.
In 2015, Blake Ross (Creator of Firefox) wrote a viral post: "I just learned that you guys can actually SEE things?"
He thought "Count sheep" was a metaphor.
It turns out 2% of the population has **Aphantasia**.

## 1. How do they think?
If I ask "Does a table have 4 legs?", a visualizer "looks" at a mental table.
An Aphant "knows" the fact: Table = 4 legs. It is a list of data, not a JPEG.
They can be artists (Ed Catmull, President of Pixar, has it).
They just can't visualize the final result; they iterate through logic.

## 2. Hyperphantasia
The opposite is **Hyperphantasia**.
People whose mental images are as real as reality.
They can rotate the apple, zoom in on the texture, smell it.
They make great eyewitnesses but suffer more from PTSD (Flashbacks are vivid).
Most of us are in the middle.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Aphantasia** is the inability to create a voluntary mental image. People with this condition cannot "picture" scenes, faces, or objects in their mind's eye. It is not a disorder, but a variation in human experience. They rely on semantic memory (facts) rather than episodic visual memory.

## Introduction: The Norwegian Woman
1941. A Norwegian woman was hit by bomb shrapnel.
She woke up speaking with a heavy German accent.
Her neighbors shunned her. They thought she was a Nazi spy.
She wasn't faking. She had **Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS)**.

## 1. It's not an Accent
It sounds like French/German to *us*.
But really, it is **Dysprosody**.
The part of the brain controlling the *timing* and *melody* (Prosody) of speech is damaged.
They elongate vowels. They pause at the wrong time.
"Heeelllooo, hoow aare yooou?"
Our brain (Paridolia) tries to categorize this strange rhythm.
"Oh, that sounds French."
If a Japanese person gets FAS, they might sound like they have a Korean accent. It is subjective.

## 2. The Tragedy
It is funny on YouTube. It is hell for the patient.
They lose their identity.
People treat them like foreigners in their own country.
"Where are you from?" "I'm from here!" "No, really?"
They often stop speaking to avoid the questions.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Foreign Accent Syndrome** is a rare speech disorder typically caused by brain damage (stroke or TBI). The patient speaks their native language with altered timing, intonation, and tongue placement, which listeners perceive as a foreign accent. It is a motor control issue, not a delusion.

## Introduction: Jill Price
Jill Price (The first case) remembers every day since 1980.
"It was a Tuesday. It was raining. I had soup. I watched 'Dallas'."
This is **Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM)**.
There are only about 60 people in the world with it.

## 1. The Burden
We forget for a reason.
Forgetting is emotional hygiene.
If you broke up 10 years ago, time heals the wound because the memory fades.
For Jill, the memory is fresh.
She relives the pain of 1993 as if it happened this morning.
Her mind is a "split screen" of the past and present constantly running.
She cannot be present.

## 2. The Caudate Nucleus
MRI scans show their **Caudate Nucleus** (OCD center) and **Temporal Lobe** are larger.
It might be a form of OCD.
They obsessively catalog their lives.
They don't have better *learning* memory (they don't ace tests).
They only have better *autobiographical* memory.
It proves that "forgetting" is an active process that our healthy brains work hard to do.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hyperthymesia** (HSAM) is a condition where an individual possesses a superior autobiographical memory. They can recall the vast majority of personal experiences and events from any given date in their past. Unlike mnemonists (who use tricks), their recall is automatic and uncontrollable.

## Introduction: The Gunshot
It happens in the twilight betwen waking and sleeping (Hypnagogia).
Loud cymbals. A bomb. A scream.
It is completely hallucinatory.
It is terrifying (People think they are having a stroke).
It is **Exploding Head Syndrome**.

## 1. The Shut-Down Glitch
When you sleep, your brain has to shut down the "Auditory Neurons".
Usually, it dims them slowly.
Sometimes, there is a glitch.
Instead of shutting down, they all fire at once.
**Neural Feedback**.
Like a microphone getting too close to a speaker.
The "Pop" is the sound of your auditory cortex rebooting.

## 2. Fear
It is harmless.
But it causes anxiety.
"If I sleep, the bomb will go off."
This leads to insomnia.
Understanding that it is just a "Biological Glitch" (like a hiccups for the brain) is usually the cure.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Exploding Head Syndrome** is a parasomnia where a person experiences a loud, imagined noise (like a bomb or gunshot) just before falling asleep. It is painless but distressing. It is hypothesized to be caused by a sudden burst of neural activity in the auditory cortex during the transition from wakefulness to sleep.

## Introduction: The Invisible Left
A patient asks: "Who put this arm in my bed?"
Doctor: "That is your arm."
Patient: "No, it's not."
This is **Hemispatial Neglect**.
Usually caused by a stroke in the **Right Parietal Lobe** (which maps space).

## 1. Attention, not Vision
The eyes work fine.
If you wave a laser on the left, their brain receives the signal.
But the "Spotlight of Attention" cannot move left.
It is like the left side of the universe ceases to exist.
If they imagine walking down a street in Milan, they can describe the shops on the right.
If they turn around mentally, they describe the *other* shops (now on the right).
The memory is intact. The access is blocked.

## 2. Prism Therapy
We can trick the brain.
We give them glasses with Prisms that shift the world 10 degrees to the right.
The brain is forced to look left to compensate.
For a few minutes after taking the glasses off, the "Left World" reappears.
It proves that Reality is constructed by Attention.

> **One-Minute Summary**
>
> **Hemispatial Neglect** is a neuropsychological condition after damage to one hemisphere (usually the right) results in a deficit in attention to and awareness of one side of the field of vision (usually the left). Patients may eat only half their food or draw only half a picture, completely unaware of the missing half.
