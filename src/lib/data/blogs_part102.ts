## Introduction: The Judge
1786. Sir William Jones (Judge in India).
He learned Sanskrit.
He noticed:
Sanskrit for Mother: *Matar*.
Latin: *Mater*.
Greek: *Meter*.
English: *Mother*.
Coincidence? No.
"They must have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists."

## 1. The Kurgan Hypothesis
The "PIE" (Proto-Indo-Europeans) lived on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe (Ukraine/Russia) ~4000 BC.
They were the first to domesticate the **Horse**.
They invented the **Wheel** (Wagon).
This technology allowed them to sweep across Europe and India, replacing local languages.
They are the ancestors of 3 billion people.

## 2. Reconstructing the Ghost Language
We have no writing from them.
But we can reverse-engineer the words by comparing descendants.
*   *Kweld* (Wheel).
*   *Sneigwh* (Snow).
*   *Pater* (Father).
*   *Dyeus Phter* (Sky Father) -> Jupiter (Latin) -> Zeus (Greek).
We know they had Honey (*Melit*) but not Bananas.
We know they had Snow. So they weren't from Africa.

## 3. The Horse
The word *Ekwos* (Horse) is in every branch.
This proves they lived with horses.
Their culture was patriarchal, warlike, and poetic.
The *Rigveda* (India) and the *Iliad* (Greece) share the same poetic meters and metaphors ("Undying Fame").

### Fact Box
*   **Basque:** The only language in Western Europe that is *not* Indo-European. It is a survivor from Pre-Indo-European Europe. They resisted the horse-lords.

## Introduction: Chaucer
Read Chaucer (1400): "Soote" (Sweet) rhymes with "Roote". Pronounced like "Soot-a".
Read Shakespeare (1600): Pronunciation is modern.
Between 1400 and 1600, the **Great Vowel Shift** happened.
Long vowels moved UP in the mouth.
*   "Mice" went from "Mees" -> "Mice".
*   "Moon" went from "Mone" to "Moon".
*   "Name" went from "Nah-meh" to "Name".

## 1. The Printing Press Freeze
The problem: The Printing Press (Caxton, 1476) arrived *during* the shift.
They standardized the spelling based on the *Old* pronunciation.
So we spell "Knight" (because they used to say "K-nee-gh-t") but we pronounce it "Nite".
We are writing Middle English and speaking Modern English.

## 2. The French Influence
1066. Normans invade.
They added French spelling rules.
"Queen" (Cwene -> Qu).
"Color" vs "Colour".
We kept the Germanic grammar (The, Is, A) but stole 50% of our vocabulary from French/Latin.
Pig (Animal, Saxon) vs Pork (Food, French). Because the Saxons raised the pig, the French ate it.

## 3. The Colonel
Why is "Colonel" pronounced "Kernel"?
It comes from Italian *Colonnello* (Column leader).
Battle of spellings.
We took the spelling from French *Coronel* (r sound).
Then changed spelling back to Italian (l).
But kept the French pronunciation (r).
Total mess.

### Fact Box
*   **Ghoti:** George Bernard Shaw joked that "Fish" could be spelled "Ghoti".
    *   Gh as in Tou**gh** (f).
    *   o as in W**o**men (i).
    *   ti as in Na**ti**on (sh).

## Introduction: The Hopi Time
Benjamin Whorf studied the Hopi tribe.
He claimed they had no concept of time as a linear flow. No "Past, Present, Future".
He argued: Language *determines* thought (Linguistic Determinism).
If true, learning a new language rewires your brain.

## 1. The Color Blue
Homer (The Odyssey) describes the sea as "Wine-Dark". He never says Blue.
Ancient languages usually name colors in this order: Black/White -> Red -> Yellow/Green -> Blue.
Some tribes (Himba) have the same word for Blue and Green.
Tests show they struggle to distinguish a Blue square from Green squares. But they can spot 50 shades of Green that we can't see.

## 2. Weak Whorfianism (Relativity)
Strong Warning (Determinisim) is debunked. We *can* think concepts without words.
But **Weak Whorfianism** is true.
Language *influences* focus.
*   **Bridge:** In German, it is feminine (*Die Brücke*). Germans describe bridges as "Elegant, slender".
*   **Bridge:** In Spanish, it is masculine (*El Puente*). Spanish describe bridges as "Strong, sturdy".
Grammatical gender changes perception.

## 3. Arrival (The Movie)
The Aliens (Heptapods) write in circles. They see time all at once.
Learning their language gives the main character the ability to remember the future.
This is extreme sci-fi Whorfianism.
But bilingual people do report distinct personalities when switching languages.
(French feels more emotional, English feels more logical?).

### Fact Box
*   **Guugu Yimithirr:** An Australian tribe doesn't use "Left/Right". They use "North/South/East/West". Even indoors. "Pass the salt to the North." They have a perfect internal compass at all times. If you blindfold them and spin them, they know where North is. We lost this because our language ignores it.

## Introduction: The Plantation
Slaves from different African tribes were mixed so they couldn't plot rebellion.
They needed to communicate.
They mixed English/French vocab with African grammar.
This is a **Pidgin**.
"Me go market." (Simplified, no native speakers, functional).

## 1. The Magic of Children (Creolization)
The children of Pidgin speakers hear this broken language.
Their brains have a "Language Acquisition Device" (Chomsky).
They instinctively *inject* grammar that wasn't there.
They add tenses, plurals, complex syntax.
The Pidgin becomes a **Creole**.
It is a fully complex, native language.
Haitian Creole. Tok Pisin (PNG).

## 2. Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL)
1980s. Nicaragua opened the first school for deaf children.
Before this, deaf kids had isolated "Home Signs".
Put together, they couldn't talk.
They invented a Pidgin sign language.
The *younger* kids (coming in later) turned it into a full grammatical language.
Linguists watched a language be born from nothing in real-time.
Proof that grammar is innate in the human brain.

## 3. Hawaiian Pidgin
"Da Kine."
It started on sugar plantations (Japanese, Filipino, Portuguese workers).
It is now a marker of local identity.
It sounds broken to English speakers, but it has strict rules.
"He stay eat" = He is eating (Continuous aspect).
"He eat" = He eats (Habitual).

### Fact Box
*   **Esperanto:** An artificial language designed to be universal. No irregular verbs. Easy to learn. 2 Million speakers. But it never became a native language for a country. Language needs culture to survive.

## Introduction: The Lost Code
Hieroglyphs died out around 400 AD (Christianity banned them).
For 1400 years, nobody could read them.
Scholars thought they were purely symbolic (Eagle = Freedom?).
They were wrong. They are phonetic.

## 1. The Discovery (1799)
Napoleon invaded Egypt.
Soldiers digging a fort in Rosetta (Rashid) found a black slab.
It had three texts:
1.  **Hieroglyphs** (Top).
2.  **Demotic** (Middle - Egyptian script).
3.  **Ancient Greek** (Bottom).
We knew Greek!
It was the same text (A tax decree) in 3 versions.
A Crib.

## 2. Champollion vs Young
Thomas Young (British) identified the name "Ptolemy" in a cartouche (oval).
Jean-Francois Champollion (French) cracked the code in 1822.
He realized the eagle wasn't "Freedom".
It was the sound "A".
The Lion was "L".
**It was an Alphabet.** (Mostly).
He ran into the street screaming "Je tiens l'affaire!" (I've got it!) and fainted.

## 3. The Power of Reading
Suddenly, the walls spoke.
We learned the names of the Pharoahs: Ramses, Thutmose.
We read their poetry, their tax returns, their love letters.
Egypt turned from a mysterious land of magic into a real civilization with real people.

### Fact Box
*   **Google Translate:** We use the term "Rosetta Stone" for AI translation models. But AI uses "Vector Space" mapping (King - Man + Woman = Queen). It doesn't need a cheat sheet; it learns from billions of parallel sentences (The web is a giant Rosetta Stone).
